                    <p>
                      The study of group presentations helps understand the more general concept of presentations in algebraic structures, including modules.
                      Presentations of modules are essential in the classification of finitely generated modules over an PID, which we will see CITEX. 
                      Specifically, we can use Smith Normal Form, a process that simplifies the presentation of a module by transforming the relation matrix into a diagonal form, revealing the structure of the module in terms of its free and torsion parts.

                  <li><title>Combinatorial Group Theory</title>
                    <p>
                      Group presentations are the cornerstone of combinatorial group theory, where groups are studied through their generators and relations.
                      For example, the word problem asks whether two words (representing elements of the group) are equivalent under the relations given by the group presentation. 
                      The difficulty of solving this problem depends on the complexity of the presentation.

                  <li><title>Geometric Group Theory</title>
                    <p>
                      The Cayley graph of a group is a graph that visually represents the group's structure in terms of its generators. 
                      The group's presentation defines the edges of the graph, with each generator corresponding to an edge between vertices (group elements). 
                      This graph-theoretic representation is central to many areas of geometric group theory, such as the study of word-hyperbolic groups.

                  <li><title>Algebraic Topology</title>
                    <p>
                      In algebraic topology, group presentations are used to describe the fundamental group <m>Ï€_1(X)</m> of a topological space <m>X</m>, which encodes information about the loops in the space up to homotopy.
                      For example, Given a CW complex (a type of topological space built from cells), the fundamental group of the space can be described using a group presentation. 
                      The generators correspond to the <m>1</m>-cells (edges), and the relations come from the <m>2</m>-cells (faces), which describe how the edges are glued together.

                  <li><title>Knot Theory</title>
                    <p>
                      The knot group of a knot <m>K</m> in <m>3</m>-dimensional space is the fundamental group of the knot complement (the space obtained by removing the knot from <m>\R^3</m>). 
                      This group is often described using a group presentation.

                  <li><title>Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Groups</title>
                    <p>
                      The fundamental group of an algebraic variety can often be computed using a group presentation, especially for varieties with a well-understood topological structure (e.g., plane curves or higher-dimensional varieties).
                    </p>

                  <li><title>Theoretical Computer Science</title>
                    <p>
                      Group presentations are connected to automata theory through the study of automatic groups, where the word problem can be solved efficiently. 
                      Groups with certain types of presentations can be recognized by finite automata, and this has applications in both algebra and computer science.

          <definition xml:id="def-free-group"><title>Free Group</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>A</m> be a set. 
                Consider a new set of symbols <m>A^{-1}=\{a^{-1} \mid a \in A\}</m>. 
                The <em>free group</em> on <m>A</m>, denoted <m>F(A)</m>, is the set of all finite words written using symbols in <m>A\cup A^{-1}</m>, including the empty word, where two words are equal if one is obtained from the other by erasing a pair of consecutive symbols <m>aa^{-1}</m> or <m>a^{-1}a</m>. 
                In symbols, 
                <me>
                  F(A)=\{a_1^{i_1}a_2^{i_2}\cdots a_m^{i_m} \mid m\geq 0, a_j\in A, i_j\in\{-1,1\}\}.
                </me> 
                The set <m>F(A)</m> is a group in which any two words are multiplied by concatenation.
              </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>

          <example>
            <p>
              The free group on a singleton set <m>A={x}</m> is the infinite cyclic group <m>C_\infty</m>. 
              It is easy to visualize this since <m>C_\infty\cong \mathbb{Z}</m>.
            </p>
          </example>

          <p>
            It is already somewhat challenging to visualize the free group on two generators, <m>F({x,y})</m>. 
            The best one can do to represent it is an infinite graph called the <em>Cayley graph</em> of this group. 
            It is obtained by starting at the origin (the center of the picture below), then branching out in four directions by a length of 1, then branching out similarly by a length of 1/2, then by 1/4, then by 1/8, etc 
            (I stopped there, to avoid cluttering the picture too much but to get the complete Cayley graph one continues infinitely obtaining a fractal kind of picture). 
            Then every element of <m>F ({x, y})</m> corresponds in a rather natural way to exactly one dot in this diagram. 
            Indeed, we can place the empty word at the center, and we can agree that every <m>x</m> in a word takes us one step to the right, every <m>x^{-1}</m> to the left, every <m>y</m> up, and every <m>y^{-1}</m> down. For example, the word <m>yx^{-1}yx</m> takes us here:

            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>A</m> be a set, let <m>F(A)</m> be the free group on <m>A</m>, let <m>H</m> be a group, and let <m>g:A \to H</m> be a function. 
                Then there is a unique homomorphism <m>f:F(A) \to H</m> satisfying <m>f(a) = g(a)</m> for all <m>a \in A</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Set <m>f:F(A) \to H</m> to be given by <m>f(a_1^{i_1}a_2^{i_2}\cdots a_m^{i_m})=g(a_1)^{i_1}g(a_2)^{i_2}\cdots g(a_m)^{a_m}</m> for any <m>m\geq 0, a_j\in A, i_j\in\{-1,1\}</m>. 
                One checks that <m>f</m> is well defined by noting that 
                <md>
                  <mrow> f(a_1^{i_1}a_2^{i_2}\cdots aa^{-1}\cdots a_m^{i_m}) &amp; =g(a_1)^{i_1}g(a_2)^{i_2}\cdots g(a)g(a)^{-1}\cdots g(a_m)^{a_m}</mrow>
                  <mrow> &amp;=f(a_1^{i_1}a_2^{i_2}\cdots a_m^{i_m})</mrow>
                </md>
                for any <m>a\in G</m> and similarly for inserting <m>a^{-1}a</m>. 
                The fact that <m>f</m> is a group homomorphism and its uniqueness are left as an exercise.

                  Then for <m>r = a_1^{i1} \cdots a_m^{i_m} \in R</m>, we have <m>f(r)=(g(a_1))^{i_1} \cdots (g(a_m))^{i_m} = e_H</m>, showing that <m>R\subseteq \operatorname{Ker}(f)</m>.

              <p>
                The UMP of the presentation says that one can build a homomorphism from a group with a given presentation to any other group <m>H</m> as long as one is able to send the generators (elements of <m>A</m>) via some function <m>g</m> to some elements of <m>H</m> that satisfy the same relations in <m>H</m> as those given in the presentation.

            <example>
              <p>
                To find a groups homomorphism <m>D_{2n}\to \operatorname{GL}_2({\mathbb{R}})</m> it suffices to find a map <m>g:\{r,s\}\to \operatorname{GL}_2({\mathbb{R}})</m>, say <m>r\mapsto R, s\mapsto S</m> and to verify that <m>S^2=I_2,R^n=I_2, SRSR=I_2</m>. 
                As you have shown on homework, this does hold for the matrices 
                <me>
                  R=\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right) &amp; -\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)&amp; \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)\end{bmatrix}, S=\begin{bmatrix}  0 &amp; 1 \\ 1&amp; 0\end{bmatrix}.
                </me> 
                By the UMP of the presentation there is a group homomorphism <m>f:D_{2n}\to \operatorname{GL}_2({\mathbb{R}})</m> that extends <m>g</m>; that is <m>f(r^is)=R^iS</m> for all <m>0\leq i&lt;n</m>.

            </example>
  
            <p>
              We can use the map above to understand the notions of isometry and orientation-preserving a little more rigorously.
              Indeed, an invertible linear transformation, equivalently an element <m>M\in \operatorname{GL}_n({\mathbb{R}})</m> is an isometry if and only if <m>\det(M)=\pm 1</m>. 
              An invertible linear transformation, equivalently an element <m>M\in \operatorname{GL}_n({\mathbb{R}})</m> is orientation-preserving if and only if <m>\det(M)&gt;0</m>. 
              Thus the group of orientation-preserving isometries of <m>{\mathbb{R}}^n</m> can be identified with <m>\operatorname{SL}_n({\mathbb{R}})</m>.
