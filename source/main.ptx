        <introduction><title>Motivation: The What, Where, and Why of Groups</title>

          <p>
            Group theory is the branch of mathematics that answers the question, "What is symmetry?"         
          </p>

          <insight>
            <p>
              There are several ways of thinking about groups, all relying or various levels of rigor and assumptions of prior experience.
              Here are several:
              <ol>
                <li><title>Symmetric</title>
                  <p>
                    A group can be thought of as a collection of symmetries or transformations that can be combined in a consistent way.
                    Common examples of symmetries include moves on a Rubik's Cube, addition and subtraction of integers, and rotations and flips of polygons.
                  </p>
                </li>
  
                <li><title>Set Theoretical</title>
                  <p>
                    A group is a set of elements together with a rule (function) for combining any two elements to get a third element in the set.
                  </p>
                </li>
  
                <li><title>Abstractions of Abstractions</title>
                  <p>
                    Groups can also be thought of as abstractions of rings, which can in turn be thought of as abstractions of common number systems, such as the integers.
                    Rings are algebraic objects with two operations (commonly addition and multiplication), whereas groups only require one operation.
                    Thus all rings can be thought of as containing groups inside them.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
          </insight>

          <p>
            Common first questions in most math settings are the staples <term>"Why are these useful?"</term> and <term>"Where are these found?"</term>.
            Despite what some mathematicians might insist, these are reasonable and often essential questions to ask when encountering a new mathematical concept.
            Questions should always be encouraged; anyone who tells you differently is either unprepared or underpaid.
          </p>

          <question>
            <statement>
              <p>
                Why are groups important? Where are they found?
              </p>
            </statement>

            <answer>
              <p>
                The short answer is almost everywhere.
                In many fields of mathematics, groups provide the abstract framework upon which large portions of the discipline are built. 
                Listed below is a thorough but nowhere near comprehensive list of fields of mathematics (and beyond) where groups make an appearence. 
                <ol>
                  <li><title>Number Theory and Cryptography</title>
                    <p>
                      As it turns out, much of elementary group theory is actually group theory in disguise: specifically, the study of <xref ref="modular-integer-group" text="custom"> modular arithmetic groups </xref> and <xref ref="subsec-groups-units" text="custom"> multiplicative groups of units </xref>. 
                      Thus many cryptographic protocols, such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography, rely on the structure of groups for their security.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li><title>Linear Algebra</title>
                    <p>
                      A vector space is essentially a field and a group working together, with elements of the group acting as vectors and elements of the field acting as scalers.
                      Additionally, the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is deeply connected to group theory: the action of a linear transformation can be studied using its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which form cyclic subgroups under repeated application of the transformation.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li><title>Commutative Algebra</title>
                    <p>
                      In many ways commutative algebra is the study of modules, which are essentially abstractions of vector spaces: where a field is required for a vector space, only a ring is needed for a module. 
                      Thus groups are once again omnipresent, though they remain mostly hidden in the machinery of the module structure.
                      <fn>This author can personally attest to the importance of this connection. As someone who struggled with modules for quite some time, it was expanding my understanding of groups that finally enabled me to grasp the inner workings of modules.</fn>

                  <li><title>Topology</title>
                    <p>
                      An essential concept in topology is that of the fundamental group, which describes the set of loops in a topological space up to continuous deformation, providing insight into the space's structure.

                  </li>
                  <li><title>Algebraic Geometry</title>
                    <p>
                      The set of points on an elliptic curve forms an abelian group, which is essential in number theory and cryptography.

                  <li><title>Representation Theory</title>
                    <p>
                      Group representations are ways in which a group can act on vector spaces, providing yet another bridge between group theory and linear algebra.

                  <li><title>Physics</title>
                    <p>
                      Groups describe symmetries in physical systems, such as the Lorentz group in special relativity and gauge groups in quantum field theory.
                      In the realm of quantum mechanics, quantization of a classical system crucially involves understanding the Lie groups that act on the classical phase space and the unitary representations of these groups.

                  <li><title>Analysis</title>
                    <p>
                      In functional analysis, groups of unitary or orthogonal matrices are crucial in studying linear operators on Hilbert spaces.
                      In complex analysis, automorphism groups of Riemann surfaces are essential in studying the geometry of complex manifolds.
                      Additionally, MÃ¶bius Transformations, the group of transformations of the complex plane that preserve angles and are used in the study of complex functions.

                  <li><title>Knot Theory</title>
                    <p>
                      A fundamental concept in knot theory is the knot group, which is an invariant that can distinguish between different knots. 
                      The knot group is defined as the fundamental group of the knot complement, and is used to derive powerful knot invariants, such as the Alexander Polynomial, the Jones Polynomial, and linking number.

                  <li><title>Algebraic Topology</title>
                    <p>
                      Homology groups are used to study the topological features of a space, such as holes and voids, in a more algebraic manner.

                  <li><title>Chemistry</title>
                    <p>
                      The set of operations associated with the symmetry elements of a molecule constitute a group.
                      Indeed, the majority of all knowledge concerning atoms, molecules, and solids has been derived from applications of group theory.

              It is perhaps natural at this stage to wonder about groups whose binary operation satisfies the commutative property.
              Some sort of <em>commutative group</em>, if you will. 
              Surely such groups will be named accordingly.

              <p>
                When working with arbitrary groups, multiplicative notation is often used as the operation. 
                Thus, groups are commonly written as <m>(G,\cdot)</m> and referred to as <em>multiplicative groups</em>.
                However, when working with abelian groups, it is customary to use additive notation, writing the group as <m>(G,+)</m>.
                Often, the letter <m>A</m> is used in place of <m>G</m> when referring to abelian groups.

                        Integer addition is associative, which means that for any three integers <m>a, b</m>, and <m>c</m>, the expression <m>(a + b) + c</m> is equal to <m>a + (b + c)</m>. 
                        Thus, associativity is satisfied for <m>\E</m>.

                      <p>
                        The identity element for addition is <m>0</m>. 
                        For any even integer <m>a</m>, adding <m>0</m> to it does not change its parity (evenness).

                        The negative of an even integer is also an even integer. 
                        Adding an even integer to its negative results in <m>0</m>, which is the identity element.

              Though it might seem natural to write the product <m>x\cdot x</m> using the notation <m>x^2</m>, we have no notion of what that means in the world of groups. 
              Do exponents behave the way we want them to in groups, or does something disasterous occur? 
              Do exponents even exist? 
              Do <em>I</em>? 
              In this section, we attempt to answer as many of these questions as is philosophically feasible.

              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        We proceed via cases:
                        First, let <m>n &gt; 0</m> and <m>m &gt; 0</m>.
                        We induct on <m>m</m>. 
                        For the base case, let <m>m=1</m>.
                        Thus we have <m>x^nx^1=x^{n+1}</m> by <xref ref="power-plus-1" text="custom"> definition </xref>.
                        Additionally, using the <xref ref="exe-general-associativity"/> we see 
                        <me>x^1x^n = x(\underbrace{x\cdots x}{n}) = (\underbrace{x\cdots x}{n})x = x^nx^1,</me>
                        and thus <m>x^nx^1=x^1x^n</m>. 
                        Hence <m>x^nx^1=x^{n+1}=x^1x^n</m>, satisfying the base case.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Now we inductively assume <m>x^nx^m=x^{n+m}=x^mx^n</m> and consider <m>x^nx^{m+1}</m>
                        Using <xref ref="def-power"/> we see <m>x^{m+1}=x^mx</m>. 
                        Substituting, we have <m>x^nx^mx^1</m>. 
                        By the inductive hypothesis, we have <m>x^nx^mx^1 = x^{n+m}x = x^{n+m+1}</m> and <m>x^nx^mx^1 = x^mx^nx</m>. 
                        Using the <xref ref="exe-general-associativity"/> again, we have <m>x^{m+1}x^n</m>.
                        Thus <m>x^nx^{m+1}=x^{n+m+1}=x^{m+1}x^n</m>, completing the induction.
                        Hence, when <m>n &gt; 0</m> and <m>m &gt; 0</m> we have <m>x^nx^m=x^{n+m}=x^mx^n</m>.
                      </p>
                      
                      <p>
                        Now suppose <m>n &gt; 0</m> and <m>m &lt; 0</m>. 
                        Thus <m>x^m = (x^{-m})\inv</m>, where <m>-m &gt; 0</m>.

                        So <m>x^nx^{-m}=x^{n+(-m)}</m>
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <m>x^nx^m = (x^{-n})\inv(x^{-m})\inv = (x^{-m}x^{-n})\inv</m>
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Multiplying on both sides by <m>x^{-m}</m> we deduce that <m>x^n =x^{-m}x^{m+n}</m> and <m>x^m = x^{m + n} x^{-n}</m>. 
                        Finally inversion of the equation <m>x^mx^n =x^{m + n}</m> yields <m>x^{-n}x^{-m} = x^{-m + (-n)}</m>. 
                        Hence the law is established in all cases.

                        If <m>n &gt; 0</m>, it follows from (1) that <m>(x^m)^n =x^{mn}</m>. 
                        Now assume that <m>n &lt; 0</m>; then <m>(x^m)^n =((x^m)^{-n})\inv =(x^{-mn})\inv =x^{mn}</m> since <m>x^{-mn}x^{mn}=e</m>.

                <p>
                  To count the number of permutations in <m>S_n</m>, we can consider the process of constructing a permutation step by step.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        For the first element, we have <m>n</m> choices. 
                        We can choose any of the <m>n</m> elements as the image of the first element.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        For the second element, we have <m>(n-1)</m> choices. 
                        After choosing the image of the first element, we have <m>(n-1)</m> remaining elements to choose from for the image of the second element.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Continuing this process, for the third element, we have <m>(n-2)</m> choices, for the fourth element we have <m>(n-3)</m> choices, and so on.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Finally, for the last element, we have only one choice remaining.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  The total number of permutations is obtained by multiplying the number of choices at each step. 
                  Hence, the total number of permutations in <m>S_n</m> is given by <m>n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \dots \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1</m>, which is equal to <m>n!</m>.
                  Therefore, the order of the symmetric group <m>S_n</m> is <m>n!</m>.

                  From these calculations, we can observe that the composition <m>(a_1\;a_2\;\cdots\;a_m) \circ (b_1\;b_2\dots\;b_n)</m> maps each element <m>a_i</m> to <m>a_{i+1}</m> (if <m>a_i \neq  a_m</m>), and it maps <m>a_m</m> to <m>a_1</m>.

                  Now, let's consider the composition <m>(b_1\;b_2\dots\;b_n) \circ (a_1\;a_2\;\cdots\;a_m)</m> and evaluate its effect on the elements <m>a_i</m> and <m>a_m</m>:

                  and

                  Comparing these results with the previous composition, we see that the effects on <m>a_i</m> and <m>a_m</m> are the same in both compositions. 
                  This implies that the compositions <m>(a_1\;a_2\;\cdots\;a_m) \circ  (b_1\;b_2\dots\;b_n)</m> and <m>(b_1\;b_2\dots\;b_n) \circ  (a_1\;a_2\;\cdots\;a_m)</m> are identical.

                        Fix <m>\sigma\in S_n</m> and let <m>G = \langle \sigma\rangle</m>. 
                        The homomorphism given as the inclusion of <m>G</m> into <m>S_n</m> determines an action of <m>G</m> on the set <m>X := \{1, \dots, n\}</m>. 
                        This action decomposes <m>X</m> into disjoint orbits. 
                        Since <m>\sigma</m> generates <m>G</m>, <m>i, j</m> belong to the same orbit iff <m>\sigma^k(i) = j</m> for some <m>k \geq 0</m>. 
                        Let <m>O</m> be any one of these orbits with size at least <m>2</m>. 
                        Now pick any element <m>i \in O</m>. 
                        Consider the sequence <me>i, \sigma(i), \sigma^2(i), \dots</me> of element of <m>O</m>. 
                        The axioms of a group action gives us that the first time this sequence has a repitition occurs when <m>\sigma^p(i_1) = i_1</m>, where <m>p = |O|</m>. 
                        Let <m>j_t =\sigma^{t+1}(i)</m> for <m>t = 1, \dots, p</m> and let <m>\tau_O</m> be the <m>p</m>-cycle <m>(j_1 \, \dots \, j_p)</m>.

                        Moreover, if the orbit of <m>\gamma_i</m> is <m>O</m>, then <m>\gamma_i</m> and <m>\sigma</m> act the same on <m>O</m> and <m>\gamma_i</m> fixes <m>\{1, \dots, n\} \setminus O</m>.

                  For an element to be in <m>A_n</m>, it must be an even permutation. 
                  This means it can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions. 
                  Each transposition in the product swaps two elements. 
                  There are <m>n</m> choices for the first element, and after fixing the first element, there are <m>(n-1)</m> choices for the second element. 
                  This gives us <m>n * (n-1)</m> choices for the first transposition.
                  For the second transposition, there are <m>(n-2)</m> choices for the first element and <m>(n-3)</m> choices for the second element. 
                  Continuing this process, we have <m>(n-2) * (n-3) * ... * 2 * 1</m> choices for the remaining transpositions.
                  In total, the number of even permutations (elements in <m>A_n</m>) is given by <m>n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1</m>, which is equal to <m>n!</m>.
                  However, we have counted each even permutation twice because we can write a given even permutation as a product in different orders. 
                  For example, <m>(1 2) * (3 4)</m> is the same as <m>(3 4) * (1 2)</m>.
                  Therefore, we divide the total number of even permutations <m>(n!)</m> by <m>2</m> to remove the duplicate counting.
                  Hence, the order of the alternating group <m>A_n</m> is <m>n!/2</m>.

                  For any integer <m>n \geq 3</m>, let <m>P_n</m> denote a regular <m>n</m>-gon<idx><h>regular <m>n</m>-gon</h></idx>. 
                  An <em>isometry</em><idx><h>isometry</h></idx> of the plane is a function <m>f: {\mathbb{R}}^2 \to {\mathbb{R}}^2</m> that is a bijection and preserves the Euclidean distance <m>(d(f(A),f(B))=d(A,B)</m> for any <m>A,B\in {\mathbb{R}}^2</m>). 
                  A <em>symmetry</em><idx><h>symmetry</h></idx> of <m>P_n</m> is an isometry that maps <m>P_n</m> to itself.

                By the latter I don't mean that <m>f</m> fixes each of the points of <m>P_n</m>, but rather that <m>f(P_n) = P_n</m>, that is every point of <m>P_n</m> is mapped to a (possibly different) point of <m>P_n</m> and every point of <m>P_n</m> is the image of some point in <m>P_n</m> via <m>f</m>.
              </p>
            </remark>

            <p>
              There are three natural types of isometry in <m>\R^2:</m>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    rotations about a point,
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    reflections in a line,
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    and translations: in the latter the point <m>(x, y)</m> is moved to <m>(x + a, y + b)</m> for some fixed <m>a, b</m>.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              It can be shown that every isometry is a rotation, a translation, a reflection, or the product of a reflection and a translation.

                  The <xref text="title" ref="def-composition"/> of two symmetries of <m>P_n</m> is again a symmetry of <m>P_n</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  Let <m>R = S \circ  T</m> be the composition of <m>S</m> and <m>T</m>, where <m>\circ </m> denotes composition. 
                  Let's take an arbitrary point <m>P</m> on the object.
                  When we apply the symmetry <m>S</m> to <m>P</m>, it is mapped to a new point, let's call it <m>P1</m>. 
                  Since <m>S</m> is a symmetry, <m>P1</m> is still on the object.
                  Next, when we apply the symmetry <m>T</m> to <m>P1</m>, it is mapped to a new point, let's call it <m>P2</m>. 
                  Again, since <m>T</m> is a symmetry, <m>P2</m> is still on the object.
                  Therefore, the composition <m>R = S \circ  T</m> maps the point <m>P</m> on the object to the point <m>P2</m>, which is also on the object.
                  Hence, the composition of symmetries is again a symmetry.

                Assume that the regular <m>n</m>-gon <m>P_n</m> is drawn in the plane with its center at the origin and one vertex on the <m>x</m> axis.

                      By our convention for how to draw <m>P_n</m>, the <m>x</m>-axis is a line of symmetry for <m>P_n</m>, and we let <m>s</m> denote reflection about the <m>x</m>-axis.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  We will use some geometric notions freely without complete justification. 
                  For example, we use that if an isometry of <m>{\mathbb{R}}^2</m> fixes two points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, then it is either the identity element or it is reflection about the line <m>AB</m>. 
                  We also use that every element of <m>D_{2n}</m> maps the origin to itself (since the origin is the center of mass of <m>P_n</m>). 
                  Finally, we use that every isometry of <m>{\mathbb{R}}^2</m> is either <em>orientation preserving</em> or <em>orientation reversing</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Label the vertices of <m>P_n</m> as <m>V_0, \dots, V_{n-1}</m>, with <m>V_0</m> being the vertex located on the positive <m>s</m>-axis, <m>V_1</m> being the vertex adjacent to <m>V_0</m> in the counter-clockwise direction, etc. 
                  We have <m>r(V_0) = V_1</m>, <m>r(V_1) = V_2</m>, etc., and so <m>r^j(V_0) = V_{j \pmod{n}}</m>. 
                  Moreover any isometry must send a vertex to a vertex because the vertices are the points on <m>P_n</m> at largest distance from the origin.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  Let <m>\alpha</m> be an arbitrary symmetry of <m>P_n</m>. 
                  Then <m>\alpha(V_0) =V_ j</m> for some <m>0 \leq j \leq n-1</m>. 
                  Then the element <m>r^{-j}\alpha</m> fixes <m>V_0</m> and the origin, and hence either <m>r^{-j}\alpha= e</m> or <m>r^{-j}\alpha= s</m> from the discussion above.

                <p>
                  Since <m>r^j(V_0) = V_{j \pmod{n}}</m>, we see that if <m>r^j = r^i</m> for <m>0 \leq i,j \leq n-1</m>, then <m>i=j</m>. 
                  We have <m>r^js \ne r^i</m> for any <m>i,j</m> since the former is orientation reversing and the latter is orientation preserving. 
                  If <m>r^is = r^js</m> for <m>0 \leq i,j \leq n-1</m>, then upon multiplying on the left of <m>s^{-1}</m> we get <m>i=j</m>.

              Intuitively, a group homomorphism preserves the algebraic structure of the group, while allowing us to compare and relate different groups. 
              In this way, group homomorphisms allow us to study the properties of groups by comparing them to other groups that we already understand well.

                        We begin by noting that <m>\{-1,1\}</m> is indeed a group, as <m>\{-1,1\}=\Z^\times</m>, as seen in <xref ref="ex-group-of-units"/>.

                        First, suppose both <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> are even permutations.
                        Thus <m>\sigma\tau</m> is an even permutation by <xref ref="prop-even-odd-properties"/>, and hence

                      <p>
                        Now suppose <m>\sigma</m> is even and <m>\tau</m> is odd.
                        Thus <m>\sigma\tau</m> is an odd permutation by <xref ref="prop-even-odd-properties"/>, and hence 
                        <me>\sign(\sigma)\sign(\tau) = (1)(-1) = (-1) = \sign(\sigma\tau).</me>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Next, suppose <m>\sigma</m> is odd and <m>\tau</m> is even.
                        Thus <m>\sigma\tau</m> is an odd permutation by <xref ref="prop-even-odd-properties"/>, and hence 
                        <me>\sign(\sigma)\sign(\tau) = (-1)(1) = (-1) = \sign(\sigma\tau).</me>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Finally, suppose both <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> are odd permutations.
                        Thus <m>\sigma\tau</m> is an even permutation by <xref ref="prop-even-odd-properties"/>, and hence

              This means that the groups are essentially the same, up to a relabeling of their elements.

                The quotation marks in the title of this result are important. 
                Equivalence relations as we know them are only defined on <em>sets</em>, but there is no set of all groups, much as there is no set of all sets.
                This dips into the realm of Russel's Paradox and higher category theory, which we will steer clear of for the time being.

            <proposition xml:id="prop-aut-is-group"><title>The Automorphism Group</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  The set of automorphisms of <m>G</m>, denoted <m>\operatorname{Aut}(G)</m>, is a group under composition.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  First, I show that operation is associative.
                  Let <m>\varphi, \phi, \psi\in\Aut(G)</m>. 
                  As <xref ref="thm-composition-associative" text="custom"> function composition is associative</xref>, we see <m>(\varphi\circ\phi)\circ\psi = \varphi\circ(\phi\circ\psi)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I claim <m>\id</m> is the identity element of <m>\Aut(G)</m>.
                  Recall from <xref ref="ex-identity-automorphism"/> that <m>\id:G\to G</m> is indeed an automorphism.
                  Let <m>\varphi\in\Aut(G)</m>. 
                  We will show <m>\varphi\circ \id=\varphi=\id\circ \varphi</m>. 
                  As all functions share the same domain and co-domain, we need only show that the functions map elements equally, 
                  Let <m>x \in G</m>, and observe:
                  <md>
                    <mrow> \varphi\circ \id(x) &amp;= \varphi(\id(x)) </mrow>
                    <mrow>  &amp;= \varphi(x) </mrow>
                    <mrow>  &amp;= \id(\varphi(x)) </mrow>
                    <mrow>  &amp;= \id\circ\varphi(x) </mrow>
                  </md>
                  Thus <m>\id</m> is indeed the identity element in <m>\Aut(G)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Finally, I show that every automorphism has an inverse, 
                  Let <m>\varphi\in\Aut(G)</m>.
                  As <m>\varphi</m> is an isomorphism, there exists a homomorphism <m>\phi: G \to G</m> such that <m>\varphi \circ \phi = \operatorname{id}</m> and <m>\phi \circ \varphi = \operatorname{id}</m>.
                  Thus <m>\phi</m> is, itself, an automorphism of <m>G</m>, and so <m>\phi\in\Aut(G)</m>, making <m>\phi</m> the inverse of <m>\varphi</m>.

                Notice that we have already shown that the composition of automorphisms is an automorphism, both through <xref ref="thm-iso-equivalence-relation"/> (as automorphisms are isomorphisms) and <xref ref="prop-aut-is-group"/> (as groups are closed under their operation)

                  I claim <m>\psi_g \circ \psi_h = \psi_{gh}</m> holds for any <m>g, h \in G</m>.

                  As <m>\psi_g \circ \psi_h = \psi_{gh}</m>, it follows <m>\psi_g \circ \psi_{g^{-1}} = \operatorname{id}_G</m> and <m>\psi_{g^{-1}} \circ \psi_g = \operatorname{id}_G</m>. 
                  This proves <m>\psi_g</m> has a two-sided inverse and hence is an isomorphism.
                  <fn>In fact, it shows that <m>(\psi_g)^{-1} = \psi_{g^{-1}}</m>.</fn>
                  Thus <m>\psi_g\in \operatorname{Aut}(G)</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>.

                      <p>
                        Assume <m>H</m> is non-empty and for all <m>x,y \in H</m>, <m>xy^{-1} \in H</m>. 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        First, we show associativity. 
                        Let <m>x,y,z\in H</m> (not necessarily distinct, as <m>H</m> might not have three distinct elements).
                        As <m>H\leq G</m> we have <m>x,y,z\in G</m>.
                        As <m>G</m> is a group is satisfies the associative property, and thus <m>(xy)z=x(yz)</m>.
                        Hence <m>H</m> satisfies the associative property as well.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        I claim that <m>e_G\in H</m>, and further that <m>e_G</m> is the identity element of <m>H</m>.
                        Since <m>H</m> is non-empty, there exists some <m>h \in H</m>. 
                        As <m>xy^{-1} \in H</m> for all <m>x,y \in H</m>, setting both <m>x</m> and <m>y=h</m> we see <m>hh\inv\in H</m>
                        Thus <m>e_G\in H</m>.
                        As <m>H\sse G</m>, we see 
                        <me>
                          e_Gx=x=xe_G
                        </me> 
                        for any <m>x\in H</m>, making <m>e_G</m> the identity element of <m>H</m>. 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Now I show each element of <m>H</m> has an inverse in <m>H</m>.
                        Let <m>h\in H</m>. 
                        By setting <m>x=e_G</m> and <m>y=h</m>, we see <m>e_Gh\inv\in H</m>.
                        As <m>e_G</m> is the identity element of <m>H</m>, we see <m>e_Gh\inv = h\inv</m>, and thus <m>h\inv\in H</m>.
                        Hence every element of <m>H</m> has an inverse contained in <m>H</m>.
                      </p> 

                      <p>
                        Finally, we must show that the restriction of the group operation of <m>G</m> to <m>H</m> is a well-defined group operation. 
                        In other words, given <m>x,y\in H</m>, it must be the case that <m>xy\in H</m>.
                        Given <m>x,y \in H</m>, from the previous paragraph we know <m>y^{-1} \in H</m>. 
                        Thus <m>xy = x(y^{-1})^{-1} \in H</m>, which is what we wanted.
                        This means 
                        This operation is associative by the axioms for the group <m>G</m>. 
                        The axioms of a group have now been established for <m>(H, \cdot)</m>.
                      </p>

                        Assume <m>H</m> is non-empty and closed under multiplication and inversion. 
                        Then, for <m>x,y\in H</m> we have <m>y^{-1}\in H</m> and <m>xy^{-1}\in H</m>. 
                        Since the hypothesis of the one-step test is satisfied, <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.

            <remark>
              <p>
                Note that in our proof of <xref ref="thm-subgroup-test"/> we actually proved something stronger along the way. 
                As we showed <m>e_G</m> is the (unique) identity element of any subgroup <m>H</m>, it is impossible to have a subgroup with a different identity element than its parent group.

                  For a subset <m>S</m> of <m>G</m>, the elements of <m>\langle S \rangle</m> can be described as: 
                  <me>
                    \langle S \rangle = \left\{x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m} \mid m \geq 0, j_1, \dots, j_m \in \mathbb{Z}\text{ and }x_1, \dots, x_m \in S \right\}.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  For notational simplicity, let

                    X= \left\{x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m} \mid m \geq 0, j_1, \dots, j_m \in \mathbb{Z}\text{ and }x_1, \dots, x_m \in S \right\}

                      <p>
                        Let <m>z\in X</m>.
                        Thus <m>z = x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m}</m>, where <m>m \geq 0, j_1, \dots, j_m \in \mathbb{Z}</m> and <m>x_1, \dots, x_m \in S</m>.

                      <p>
                        Since <m>\langle S \rangle</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> containing <m>S</m>, we see <m>x_1, \dots, x_m\in \igen S</m>.
                        Additionally, given the group group structure of <m>\langle S \rangle</m> it is closed under products and inverses, and thus contains <m>x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m}</m>.
                        Hence <m>z\in \igen S</m> and <m>X\sse\igen S</m>

                      <p>
                        First, notice <m>S \ne \emptyset</m>, since we allow <m>m = 0</m> and declare the empty product to be <m>e_G</m>.

                      <p>
                        Let <m>x = x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m}</m> and <m>y = y_1^{i_1} \cdots y_n^{i_m}</m> be arbitrary in <m>X</m>.
                        Thus <m>x_j, y_i\in S</m> for all <m>i,j</m>.
                        By <xref ref="thm-group-inverses"/> (2), we have:

                        As <m>x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m} y_n^{-i_m} \cdots y_1^{-i_1}\in X</m> as well, we see <m>X\leq G</m> by the <xref ref="thm-one-step" text="custom"> one-step subgroup test</xref>.

                      <p>
                        Since <m>\igen S</m> is defined to be the intersection of all subgroups of <m>G</m> containing <m>S</m>, we have <m>\igen S\sse X</m>, completing the proof.

              We look now at generating <m>S_n</m>; the following lemma will be helpful.
            </p>

            <lemma xml:id="lem-generating-sn">
              <statement>
                <p>
                  For <m>\sigma\in S_n</m> and distinct intgers <m>i_1, \dots, i_p</m> we have 
                  <me>
                    \sigma(i_1 \, i_2 \, \cdots i_p) \sigma^{-1} = (\sigma(i_1) \, \cdots \, \sigma(i_p)).
                  </me> 
                  (Note that the right-hand cycle is a cycle since <m>\sigma</m> is one-to-one.)
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  To prove this, evaluate both sides at <m>\sigma(i_t)</m> for any <m>t</m> and observe that one gets <m>\sigma(i_{t+1})</m> (with the supscript taken modulo <m>p</m>) both times. 
                  This proves they agree on the set <m>\sigma(\{i_1, \dots, i_p\})</m>. 
                  If <m>j</m> is not in this set, then <m>(i_1 \, i_2 \, \cdots i_p)</m> fixes <m>\sigma^{-1}(j)</m> so the left-hand side fixes <m>j</m>. 
                  So does the right, since <m>\sigma^{-1}(j) \notin \{\sigma(i_1), \dots, \sigma(i_p)\}</m>. 
                  Thus the two functions coincide on elements.

            <example xml:id="ex-commutator-subgroup"><title>Commutator Subgroup</title>
              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a group, <m>S=\{aba\inv b\inv|a,b\in G\}</m>, and <m>G'=\igen S</m>. 
                This is known as the <term>commutator subgroup</term>

            <remark>
              <p>
                Commutator subgroups prove invaluable when it comes to something called <em>abelianization</em>, which is, loosely speaking, a way of "modding out" the non-commutative part of <m>G</m> to obtain a new group that is abelian. 
                This is seen rigorously in <xref ref="ex-abelianization"/>.

              A nice property of a <xref text="title" ref="def-gensubgroup"/> is that once you've located the generators, you've found the whole group:

              In this way, if we can understand something about the generators of a group, we can (for the most part) extend that knowledge to the group as a whole. 
              This is something you may have seen in the form of a basis, either for a vector space or a topological space.

            </definition>

            <p>
              Recalling <xref ref="lem-gensubgp"/>, we can describe the elements of a cylic group explicitely.
            </p>

            <corollary xml:id="cor-cyclic-subgroup"><title>Elements of <m>\igen x</m></title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  For an element <m>x</m> of <m>G</m>, the elements of <m>\langle x \rangle</m> can be described as: <m>\langle x\rangle=\{x^j \mid j\in \mathbb{Z}\}</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  By <xref ref="lem-gensubgp"/>, the group <m>G</m> has the following elements <m>G=\{x^i \mid i\in \mathbb{Z}\}</m>. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  First, we show <m>|G|\geq n</m>. 
                  I claim each of the elements <m>x^0, x^1, \dots, x^{n-1}</m> are distinct.
                  Indeed, if <m>0\leq i&lt;j&lt;n</m> and <m>x^i=x^j</m> then <m>x^{j-i}=e</m> and <m>1\leq j-i&lt;n</m>, contradicting the minimality of the order of <m>x</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Next, we show <m>|G|\leq n</m>.
                  I claim <m>G\subseteq\{x^0, x^1, \dots, x^{n-1}\}</m> (this implies <m>G=\{e,x,\ldots,x^{n-1}\}</m>). 
                  Indeed, for any <m>m\in \mathbb{Z}</m> <xref ref="thm-division-algorithm" text="custom"> division</xref> by <m>n</m> yields integers <m>q,r</m> with <m>0\leq r\leq n-1</m> such that <m>m=nq+r</m>. 
                  Then <m>x^m=x^{nq+r}=(x^n)^qx^r=x^r\in\{x^0, x^1, \dots, x^{n-1}\}</m>.
                </p>

              One quick way of seeing if a finite group is cyclic is to find an element with the same order as the group.

                is a subgroup of <m>(\mathbb{C}\setminus \{0\}, \cdot)</m>. 
                Since <m>\|z\|^n = \| z^n \|</m> and so if <m>z \in \mu</m>, then <m>\|z\| = 1</m> and hence <m>z = e^{ri}</m> for some real number <m>r</m>. 
                Moreover, <m>1 = z^n = e^{nri}</m> implies that <m>nr</m> is an integer multiple of <m>2 \pi</m>. 
                It follows that 
                <me>\mu_n = \{1, e^{2 \pi i/n}, e^{4 \pi i/n}, \cdots , e^{(n-1) 2 \pi i/n}\}</me> 
                and that <m>e^{2 \pi i/n}</m> generates <m>\mu_n</m>. 
                So, <m>\mu_n</m> is cyclic or order <m>n</m>. 
                It is therefore isomorphic to <m>\mathbb{Z}/n</m>, via the map <m>\overline{j} \mapsto e^{2 j \pi i/n}</m>.

              One of the first things one does when encountering a new group is to examine its subgroups. 
              As it turns out, cyclic groups have some very special properties when it comes to subgroups, though proving them will be more technical than anything we have encountered thus far.

            <p>
              Finally, we end with two results that will prove invaluable later in the course. 
              Though we won't see them for some time, proving them now will be good practice and save us time later on.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G=\langle x\rangle</m>, where <m>x</m> has finite order <m>n</m>. 
                  For any <m>\{e\}\neq H\leq G</m>, setting <m>k=\min\{i \mid i\in \mathbb{Z}, i&gt;0, x^i\in H\}</m> gives that <m>H=\langle x^k \rangle</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Since <m>H\subseteq G=\langle x\rangle</m> any element of <m>H</m> is of the form <m>x^m</m> for some <m>m\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. 
                  By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-division-algorithm"/> <m>m=kq+r</m> for some <m>r\in \mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>0\leq r&lt;k</m>. 
                  Since <m>x^m</m> and <m>x^k</m> are elements of <m>H</m>, <m>x^r=x^m(x^{k})^{-q}\in H</m>. 
                  Since <m>r&lt;k</m> and <m>x^r\in H</m>, by the minimality of <m>k</m> it follows that <m>r</m> cannot be positive and thus <m>r=0</m>. 
                  Therefore <m>m=kq</m> and we have shown that <m>H\subseteq \langle x^k \rangle</m>. 
                  The opposite containment follows because <m>x^k\in H</m> and <m>\langle x^k \rangle</m> is the smallest subgroup of <m>G</m> containing <m>x^k</m>. 
                  Thus <m>H=\langle x^k \rangle</m>.

                  In particular, all subgroups of <m>G</m> are cyclic and there is a unique subgroup of each order.

              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>\Psi : \{\text{divisors of } |G|\} \to \{\text{subgroups of } G\} \text{ given by } \Psi(d) = \langle x^{\frac{|G|}{d}}\rangle</m> and  <m>\Phi:\{\text{subgroups of } G\} \to  \{\text{divisors of } |G|\}</m> be given by <m>\Phi(H)=|H|</m>.
                  I claim that for any divisor <m>d</m> of <m>|G|</m>, we have <m>(\Psi\circ\Phi)(d)=d</m>.
                </p>
              
                <p>
                  We have <m>(\Psi\circ\Phi)(d)=\left| \langle g^{\frac{|G|}{d}}\rangle\right|=\left| g^{\frac{|G|}{d}}\right|=\frac{|G|}{\operatorname{gcd}(|G|/d,|G|)}=\frac{|G|}{|G|/d}=d</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For any subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m>, we have <m>(\Phi\circ\Psi)(H)=H</m>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  By <xref ref="lem-cyclic-sub-gen"/> any <m>H\leq G</m> is either <m>H=\{e\}</m>, for which <m>(\Phi\circ\Psi)(\{e\})=\Phi(1)=\langle g^{|G|} \rangle=\{e\}</m> or is of the form <m>H=\langle g^k \rangle</m>. 
                  In the latter case, setting <m>|G|=n</m> we have <m>|H|=|g^k|=\frac{n}{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}</m> and <m>(\Phi\circ\Psi)(H)=\langle g^{\frac{n}{n/\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}} \rangle=\langle g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}\rangle.</m>.
                  It remains to show that <m>\langle g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}\rangle=\langle g^k\rangle=H</m>. 
                  By BÃ©zout's Identity, <m>\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)=an+bk</m> for some integers <m>a,b</m>. 
                  Since <m>g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}=(g^n)^a(g^k)^b=e^a(g^k)^b=(g^k)^b\in \langle g^k \rangle</m> if follows that <m>\langle g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}\rangle \subseteq \langle g^k \rangle</m>. 
                  On the other hand <m>k</m> is a multiple of <m>\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)</m> so <m>g^k\in \langle g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}\rangle</m> and thus <m>\langle g^k \rangle \subseteq \langle g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}\rangle</m>. 
                  Finally, we conclude that <m>(\Phi\circ\Psi)(\langle g^k \rangle)=\langle g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}\rangle=\langle g^k \rangle</m> for any <m>k\in \mathbb{Z},k&gt;0</m>.

                <p>
                  Thus <m>\Phi</m> is a two sided inverse to <m>\Phi</m>, making <m>\Phi</m> a bijection.

        <introduction><title>Motivation: Normal Subgroups and Quotient Groups</title>

          <p>
            Normal subgroups and quotients are intimately related. 
            As we will see, quotients groups can only be formed using normal subgroups.
            Normal subgroups are also fundamentally connected to group homomorphisms; kernels are always normal subgroups, and, as it turns out, normal subgroups are always kernels as well!
          </p>

          <p>
            A group that contains no non-trivial normal subgroups is called <em>simple</em>. 
            The classification of finite simple groups is one of the pioneering achievements in mathematics. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Quotients are essential in group theory for several reasons, primarily related to understanding the structure of groups, simplifying problems, and building new mathematical objects from existing ones.

                <p>
                  On of the seminal theorems of group theory that we will prove is the First Isomorphism Theorem.
                  Without getting into too many details, the First Isomorphism Theorem shows that every homomorphism 'induces' a isomorphism between a quotient group of the domain and a subgroup of the codomain.
                  This allows mathematicians to study the properties of homomorphisms by examining their kernels and images.

                <p>
                  The presence (or absence) of normal subgroups in a group helps determine its structure. 
                  Simple groups, which have no non-trivial normal subgroups, are the building blocks for all finite groups.

                <p>
                  Abelian groups are some of the most thoroughly understood objects in group theory.
                  Thus, understanding the ways in which more complex groups 'behave' like abelian groups provides powerful insights into their structures and inner workings.

                  For <m>H \leq G</m>, the collection of left cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> form a partition of <m>G</m>, and similarly for the collection of right cosets.

                <p>
                  Let me prove the assertions for right cosets. 
                  Every element <m>g</m> of <m>G</m> belongs to at least one right coset, since <m>g \in Hg</m> (since <m>e \in H</m>). 
                  We need to show any two cosets are either identical or disjoint: if <m>Hx</m> and <m>Hy</m> share an element, then it follows from <m>(1)\Rightarrow (6)</m> of <xref ref="lem-cosetfacts" /> that <m>Hx=Hy</m>. 
                  This proves that the right cosets partition <m>G</m>. 
                  To see that all right cosets have the same cardinality as <m>H</m>, define a function 
                  <me>
                    \rho: H \to Hg

                  We see <m>\rho</m> is onto and if <m>\rho(h) = \rho(h')</m> then <m>hg = h'g</m> and hence <m>h = h'</m>, so that <m>\rho</m> is also one-to-one.

              Sometimes it is convenient to ignore a certain subobject of a given object and to focus on the remaining properties. 
              Formally, this is done by taking <em>quotients</em>. 
              In contrast to the theory of vector spaces, where the quotient of any vector space by any subspace again naturally forms a vector space, we have to be a little bit more careful in the world of groups. 
              Only special subgroups lead to quotient <em>groups</em>:

            <p>
              Arguably, the most important and / or intuitive characterization of normal subgroups comes from their relation to homomorphisms. 
              Indeed, though we currenly lack the tools to prove it, <xref ref="thm-norm-iff-ker"/> tells us that a subgroup is normal if and only if it is the kernel of some homomorphism.
              Thus, in addition to its necessity in the definition of quotients, a normal subgroup is a simple and unique way to characterize any homomorphism.

              We return now to the equivalence relation induced by the set of left (or right) cosets on a group <m>G</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let us ask a question: When does <m>G/\sim</m> aquire the structure of a group under the operation 
              <me>
                [x] \cdot [y] := [xy]?
              </me> 
              We need to be worried about whether this operation is independent of choice. 
              That is, if <m>[x] = [x']</m> and <m>[y] = [y']</m> then must <m>[xy] = [x'y']</m>? 
              In other words, if <m>x\sim x'</m> and <m>y \sim y'</m>, must <m>xy \sim x'y'</m>?

              As it turns out (serendipidous, I know) we discovered the exact property a subgroup needs to ensure its cosets form a well-defined group.

                  Surjectivity is immediate from the definition.

                  First, suppose <m>K\nsg G</m>. Let <m>H=G/K</m> (which is a group since <m>K</m> is normal in <m>G</m>) and define <m>\varphi: G\to G/K</m> such that <m>\varphi(g)=gK</m>. 
                  Let <m>k\in K</m>, and observe that <m>\varphi(k)=kK=K</m>, and so <m>k\in\ker(\varphi)</m>. Let <m>g\in\ker(\varphi)</m>, meaning that <m>\varphi(g)=K</m>, placing <m>g\in K</m>.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group with center <m>Z(G)</m>, and suppose <m>G/Z(G)</m> is cyclic.
                  Let <m>x,y\in G</m>.
                  If either <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> are in the center of <m>G</m>, then <m>xy=yx</m>, as desired.
                  Suppose then neither <m>x</m> nor <m>y</m> are in the center of <m>G</m>.
                  Thus <m>xZ(G)</m> and <m>yZ(G)</m> are non-identity cosets in <m>G/Z(G)</m>.
                  As <m>G/Z(G)</m> is cyclic, there exists some <m>z\in G</m> such that <m>G/Z(G)=\{zZ(G)^j|j\in\Z\}</m>.

                        The fact that the inverse function also sends normal subgroups to normal subgroups is a consequence of the statement that inverse images of normal subgroups are normal subgroups.

                  Given a homomorphism <m>\rho</m>, the function <m>G \times S \to S</m> defined as <m>g \cdot s = \rho(g)(s)</m> is an action because <m>g'(gs) = \rho(g')(\rho(g)(s)) = (\rho(g') \circ\rho(g))(s) = \rho(gg')(s) = (gg')s</m>, and <m>e_G s = \rho(e_G)(s) = \text{id}(s) = s</m>.

              An immediate perk of this result is that we already know a lot of things about homomorphisms, and we can thus extend that knowledge into the realm of group actions at our leisure.

            <remark>
              <p>
                In many cases, transitivity and faithfulness are related concepts. 
                As we will see later, if a group action is transitive on a set <m>X</m>, then the action is faithful if and only if the stabilizer of any element of <m>X</m> is trivial. 
                In these situations we can identify the group with a subgroup of the symmetric group on <m>X</m>, and use this identification to study the group.

              Here is a convenient way of checking the conjugacy of two permutations.

            <proposition xml:id="prop-perm-conj"><title>Conjugate Permutations</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Two elements of <m>S_n</m> are conjugate if and only if they have the same cycle type.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  If two elements of <m>S_n</m> are conjugate, say <m>\beta = \sigma\alpha \sigma^{-1}</m>, then they have the same cycle type, since we may write <m>\alpha</m> as a product of disjoint cycles <m>\alpha = \alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_m</m> and then apply <xref ref="lem-generating-sn"/>. 
                  Indeed, <m>\sigma\alpha \sigma^{-1} = (\sigma\alpha_1 \sigma^{-1})  \cdots (\sigma\alpha_m \sigma^{-1})</m> and the <xref ref="lem-generating-sn"/> shows that the right-side is a product of disjoint cycles.

                  Let <m>N\nsg G</m>.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Define the conjugation action of <m>G</m> on <m>N</m> by <m>g\cdot n=gng^{-1}</m> for all <m>g\in G</m> and <m>n\in N</m>. 
                  Since <m>N\nsg G</m> this is well defined. 
                  The two properties in the definition of the action hold for the action of <m>G</m> by <xref text="title" ref="ex-conj"/> on <m>N</m> since they hold more generally for the action of <m>G</m> by conjugation on <m>G</m>. 
                  Therefore this is indeed an action. 
                  The orbits of elements <m>n\in N</m> under this action are <m>C_G(n)</m>. 
                  Thus the conjugacy classes of the elements of <m>N</m> partition <m>N</m>.

              The information encoded in a group action has two basic parts: one part tells us where points go and the other part tells us how points stay put. 
              The following terminology refers to these ideas.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  An action is transitive if and only if there is exactly one orbit under the action.
                  Similarly, an action is transitive if and only if every stabilizer is trivial.

            </corollary>

            <p>
              Lets look at some group actions of a more geometric flavor. 
              <fn>What do you think geometry tastes like? Which field of mathematics would taste the best?</fn>
            </p>
  
            <example xml:id="ex-cube"><title>Symmetries of the Cube</title>
              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be the group of rotational symmetries of the cube and let <m>G</m> act on the collection of <m>6</m> faces of the cube in the evident way. 
                This action is transitive and so the one and only orbit has length <m>6</m>. 
                It follows that for any face <m>f</m> of the cube, <m>G_f</m> has index <m>6</m> and, since we already know that <m>|G|= 24</m>, it follows from <xref ref="thm-LOIS"/> that <m>|G|_f = 4</m>. 
                That is, there are four symmetries that map <m>f</m> to itself. 
                Indeed, they are the <m>4</m> rotations by <m>0</m>, <m>90</m>, <m>180</m> or <m>270</m> degrees about the line of symmetry passing through the mid-point of <m>f</m> and the mid-point of the opposite face.
              </p>
            </example>

            <p>
              That was fun and all, but I just feel like there weren't enough faces...
            </p>
  
            <example xml:id="ex-dodec"><title>Symmetries of the Dodecahedron</title>
              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be the group of rotatoinal symmetries of the dodecahedron (<m>12</m> pentagonal faces). 
                The evident action of <m>G</m> on the twleve faces is transitive. 
                For each face <m>f</m>, <m>G_f</m> clearly has <m>5</m> elements: the five rotations about the line joining the midpoint of <m>f</m> to the midpoint of the face on the opposite side. 
                Since <m>12 = [G: G_f]</m> and <m>|G|_f = 5</m>, we conclude <m>|G| = 60</m>.
              </p>
            </example>  

            <p>
              As a final note, we are now able to connect the concepts of transitive and faithful actions in a more meaningful way.
            </p>

            <theorem xml:id="thm-transfaith"><title>Transitive and Faithful</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Suppose that <m>G</m> is an abelian group acting transitively and faithfully on a set <m>X</m>. 
                  Then <m>|G|=|X|</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>u \in X</m>. 
                  As the action is transitive, by the exercise above we have that the kernel of the action is the intersection of <m>gG_ug\inv</m> over all <m>g \in G</m>. 
                  However, as <m>G</m> is abelian, <m>gG_ug\inv = G_u</m> for all <m>g \in G</m>. 
                  Hence, the kernel of the action is <m>G_u</m> for any <m>u \in X</m>. 
                  On the other hand, the action is faithful, which means the kernel of the action is the identity. 
                  It follows that <m>G_u = \{e\}</m> for every <m>u \in X</m>. 
                  Finally, as the action is transitive, <m>X = \Orb(u)</m> for some (any) <m>u \in X</m>. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-orbit-stabilizer"/>, <m>|X|= |\Orb(u)|= [G : G_u] = |G|</m>.

              We come to a very powerful technique for analyzing finite groups of relatively small order. 
              One aspect of Sylow theory is that it allows us to deduce, in certain special cases, the existence of a unique subgroup of a given order, and thus it allows one to construct a normal subgroup.

                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a finite group, <m>p</m> a prime, <m>P</m> a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>, and <m>Q</m> any <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. 
                  Then <m>Q \cap N_G(P) = Q \cap P</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Since <m>P \leq N_G(P)</m>, we have <m>Q \cap P \leq Q \cap N_G(P)</m>. 
                  For the reverse containment, let <m>H =  Q \cap N_G(P)</m>. 
                  Since <m>H \subseteq N_G(P)</m>, <m>PH</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>. 
                  (Technically, we only proved <m>PH</m> is a subgroup if <m>N_G(P) = G</m>, but the proof applies verbatim provided the weaker condition <m>H \subseteq N_G(P)</m> holds.) 
                  Also <me>|(PH)| = \frac{(|P|) (|H|)}{|(P \cap H)|}</me> and since each of <m>|P|</m>, <m>|H|</m>, and <m>|(P \cap H)|</m> is a power of <m>p</m>, <m>PH</m> is a <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. 
                  But <m>P \leq PH</m> and <m>P</m> is a <m>p</m>-subgroup of largest possible order. 
                  So <m>P = PH</m>. 
                  This proves <m>H \leq P</m> and thus <m>H \leq Q\cap P</m>.

                          |G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_{i=1}^k [G: C_G(g_i)]
                        </me> 
                        where <m>g_1, \dots, g_k</m> are a complete and non-redundant list of non-central conjugacy class representatives. 
                        Since <m>p \nmid |Z(G)|</m> and <m>p \mid |G|</m>, we must have <m>p \nmid [G:C_G(g_i)]</m> for at least one <m>i</m>. 
                        For this <m>i</m>, we have <m>|C_G(g_i)|= p^e j</m> where <m>p \nmid j</m>. 
                        Since <m>g_i</m> is not central, <m>|C_G(g_i)| &lt; |G|</m> and hence, by induction, <m>C_G(g_i)</m> contains a subgroup of order <m>p^e</m>. 
                        But this subgroup is also a subgroup of <m>G</m>.

                        Let <m>P</m> be a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup and let <m>Q</m> be any <m>p</m>-subgroup. 
                        Let <m>\mathcal S_P</m> denote the collection of all conjugates of <m>P</m>: 
                        <me>
                          \mathcal S_P = \{ gPg^{-1} \mid g \in G\}.
                        </me> 
                        Part (3) tells us the <m>\mathcal S_P</m> consists of all Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m>, but we don't yet know this. 
                        Nonetheless, <m>G</m> acts (transitively) on <m>\mathcal S_P</m> by conjugation, and thus <m>Q</m> also acts on <m>\mathcal S_P</m> (not necessarily transitively). 
                        The key to proving parts (2) and (3) of the Sylow Theorem is to analyse the action of <m>Q</m> on <m>\mathcal S_P</m> to establish <xref ref="E1030" /> and <xref ref="E1030b" /> below.
                      </p>

                        Let <m>O_1, \dots, O_s</m> be the orbits of the action of <m>Q</m> on <m>\mathcal S_P</m>, and for each <m>i</m> pick a representative <m>P_i \in O_i</m>. 
                        We have <m>\operatorname{stab}_Q(P_i) = \{q \in Q \mid qP_iq^{-1} = P_i\} = Q \cap N_G(P_i) = Q \cap P_i</m>, where the last equation uses the Lemma. 
                        By LOIS, we thus have <m>|O_i| = [Q: Q \cap P_i]</m> and hence 
                        <md>

                        This equation holds for any <m>p</m>-subgroup <m>Q</m> of <m>G</m>. 
                        In particular, we can take <m>Q = P_1</m>. 
                        In this case the first term is <m>1</m> and, since <m>Q \cap P_i = P_1 \cap P_i &lt; P_1 = Q</m> for all <m>i \ne 1</m>, the remaining terms are divisible by <m>p</m>. 
                        This gives

                        Then <m>Q \cap P_i &lt; Q</m> for all <m>i</m> and thus every term on the right-hand side of <xref ref="E1030" /> is divisble by <m>p</m>, contrary to <xref ref="E1030b" />. 
                        The second assertion in (2) follows by taking <m>Q</m> to be a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup.

                      <p>
                        This proves, in particular, that <m>\mathcal S_P</m> in fact does consist of all Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups.

              <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> provides a systematic way of analyzing the subgroups of a finite group. 
              It allows us to determine the number of subgroups of a given order, which is useful in many applications, such as studying the structure of solvable and simple groups. 
              The theorems also provide information about the normalizers of subgroups, which can be used to study normal subgroups and quotient groups.

                  Any subgroup of <m>S_4</m> of order <m>8</m> is a Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>, the number of Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups is either <m>1</m> or <m>3</m>. 
                  As any <m>2</m>-cycle or <m>4</m>-cycle must be contained in a Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup (since such elements generate subgroups of order <m>2i</m>, for some <m>i</m>) and there are six <m>2</m>-cycles and six <m>4</m>-cycles, there has to be more than one Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup. 
                  Hence, there are precisely <m>3</m> distinct subgroups of order <m>8</m>.                  
                </p>

                <p>
                  As all of them are conjugate, and conjugation induces an isomorphism on the group, we see that all three subgroups are isomorphic. 
                  Hence, we just need to show that <m>S_4</m> contains a subgroup isomorphic to <m>D_8</m>. Let <m>X</m> be the set of left cosets of the subgroup <m>\{e,s\}</m> of <m>D_8</m>. 
                  Note that <m>|X| = 4</m>. 
                  Let <m>G</m> act on <m>X</m> by left multiplication. 
                  This action induces a homomorphism <m>\varphi : G \to P(X)</m> where <m>P(X)\cong S_4</m> is the permutation group on <m>X</m>. 
                  As shown in class, the kernel of this homomorphism is the largest normal subgroup contained in <m>\{e,s\}</m>, which is <m>\{e\}</m>. 
                  Thus, <m>\varphi</m> is injective and the image of <m>\varphi</m> is a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> isomorphic to <m>D_8</m>.

                  Let <m>G</m> be any group of order <m>12</m>. 
                  We will prove that <m>G</m> must have either a normal subgroup of order <m>3</m> or a normal subgroups of oder <m>4</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> gives that <m>n_2=|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)|</m> is either <m>1</m> or <m>3</m> and <m>n_3= |\operatorname{Syl}_3(G)|</m> is either <m>1</m> or <m>4</m>. 
                  If either of these numbers is <m>1</m>, we have a unique subgroup of order <m>4</m> or of order <m>3</m>, and such a subgroup must be normal. 
                  Suppose these numbers are <m>3</m> and <m>4</m>, respectively. 
                  We deduce a contradition by <q>counting elements</q>.

                <p>
                  In detail, say <m>P_1, \dots, P_4</m> are the <m>4</m> Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> <m>P_i \cap P_j = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i \ne j</m>. 
                  Thus the <em>set</em> <m>T := \bigcup_{i=1}^4 P_i</m> has <m>9</m> elements, one of which is <m>e</m> and the other <m>8</m> of which must have order <m>3</m>. 
                  That is, there are <m>8</m> elements of order <m>3</m> in <m>G</m>. 
                  But now consider the three Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups <m>Q_1, Q_2, Q_3</m>. 
                  Each has order <m>4</m> and <m>Q_i \cap T = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i</m>. 
                  It follows that <m>Q_i = \{e\} \cup (G \setminus T)</m> for all <m>i</m>, and thus <m>Q_1 = Q_2 = Q_3</m>, a contradiction.

              <p>
                In the previous example, it would not be so easy to count elements of order <m>2</m> and <m>4</m>. 
                We do know that every element in <m>S := \cup_i Q_i</m> has order <m>1</m>, <m>2</m> or <m>4</m> (any only one has order <m>1</m>), but the size of this set is harder to calculate. 
                For notice that <m>Q_i \cap Q_j</m> might have order <m>2</m>. 
                The most one can say for sure is that <m>S</m> has at least <m>4 + 4 - 2 = 6</m> elements.

                  The <q>counting elements trick</q> would work, but let's proceed in a different way: Consider the action of <m>G</m> on <m>\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)</m> by conjugation and let <me>\rho: G \to S_5</me> be the associated homomorphism (obtained by choosing a numbering <m>1, \dots, 5</m> of the members of <m>\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)</m>). 
                  The map <m>\rho</m> is non-trivial since the action is transitive (part (2) of <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>). 
                  But <m>80</m> does not divide <m>120</m> and so <m>\rho</m> cannot be injective. 
                  It follows that <m>\operatorname{ker}(\rho)</m> is a non-trivial, proper normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, a contradiction.

                  If any of these is <m>1</m>, then the corresonding Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup is unique and hence normal, a contradiction.

                <p>
                  Although it is not actually needed here, let's show <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)|</m> cannot be <m>3</m> or <m>5</m>. 
                  For example, if it were <m>5</m>, then the action of <m>G</m> on <m>\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)</m> (by conjugation) gives a homomorphism <m>\rho: G \to S_5</m>.
                  Since the action is transitive, this homomorphism cannot be the trivial map. 
                  Since <m>90</m> does not divide <m>120</m>, this map cannot be injective. 
                  Thus the kernel of <m>\rho</m> is a non-trivial, proper normal subgroup, a contradiction. 
                  In a similar way one shows <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| \ne 3</m>.
                </p>

                <p>	
                  We have shown that the only possibility is 
                  <me>
                    |\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| = 15, |\operatorname{Syl}_3(G)| = 10, { \text{ and } } |\operatorname{Syl}_5(G)| = 6.
                  </me> 
                  One is now tempted to count elements: we have <m>15</m> elements of order <m>2</m> and <m>6 \cdot 4 = 24</m> elements of order <m>5</m>. 
                  But elements of order <m>3</m> are not so easy to count since the various Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups have nine elements each and might interect in subsets of order <m>3</m>. 
                  The only obvious things is that there are at least <m>9 + 9 -3 = 15</m> of them. 
                  This does not give enough elements to reach a contradiction.
                </p>
                  
                <p>
                  The action of <m>G</m> on <m>\operatorname{Syl}_g(5)</m> leads to a homomorphism <m>G \to S_6</m>, but since <m>90</m> does divide <m>6!</m>, there is no contradiction lurking here either.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  So, we must resort to something really sneaky: let <m>P_1, \dots, P_{10}</m> be all of the Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups. 
                  Observe that <em>if</em> <m>P_i \cap P_j = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i \ne j</m>, then we would have <m>10 \cdot 8 = 80</m> elements of order <m>3</m> or <m>9</m>. 
                  This would give at least <m>80+ 15 + 24</m> elements, which is not possible. 
                  So, it must be the case that at least two intersect non-trivially. 
                  Without loss, let's say <m>H = P_1 \cap P_2</m> is such that <m>|H|= 3</m>. 
                  We ponder <m>N_G(H)</m>. Since <m>P_1</m> is abelian and <m>H \leq P_1</m>, <m>P_1 \leq N_G(H)</m>, so that <m>9 \mid |N_G(H)|</m>. 
                  Likewise, <m>P_2 \leq N_G(H)</m> too, and since <m>|(P_1 \cup P_2)| = 9 + 9 - 2 = 15</m>, we get <m>15 \leq N_G(H)</m>. 
                  And of course <m>|N_G(H)| \mid 90</m>.
                  We get only three possibilities: 
                  <me>
                    |N_G(H)| = 18, 45 \text{ or } 90.
                  </me> 
                  Let us show that each is impossible:
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  If <m>|N_G(H)| = 18</m>, then we have constructed a subgroup of <m>G</m> of index <m>5</m>. 
                  The action of <m>G</m> on the left cosets gives a homomorphism <m>G \to S_5</m> that cannot be the trivial map since the action is transitive. 
                  But it cannot be injective either, and this leads to a non-trivial nomal subgroup. 
                  The exact same reasoning shows <m>|N_G(H)|</m> cannot be <m>45</m> (or we could use that it has index <m>2</m>). 
                  Finally, if <m>|N_G(H)| = 90</m>, then <m>H \unlhd G</m>, which is also impossible.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  If <m>G</m> is a simple group of order <m>60</m>, then <m>G \cong A_5</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Assume <m>G</m> is simple of order <m>60</m>. 
                  Let us first observe that it suffices to construct a non-trivial action of <m>G</m> on a set with <m>5</m> elements. 
                  For given such an action we obtain a non-trivial homomorphism <m>g: G \to S_5</m>. 
                  Since it's non-trivial and <m>G</m> is simple, we must have <m>\operatorname{ker}(g) = \{e\}</m>, so that <m>g</m> is injective. 
                  Thus <m>G \cong \operatorname{im}(g)</m>, and <m>|\operatorname{im}(g)| = 60</m>. 
                  But we already know that <m>A_5</m> is the only subgroup of <m>S_5</m> of order <m>60</m>, and thus <m>G \cong \operatorname{im}(g)=A_5</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  So, we only need to find such an action, and one's first guess would be the action on one of the sets of Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups. 
                  By Sylow Theory and the fact that <m>G</m> is simple (so that no Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup for <m>p=2,3,5</m> can be unique) we get 
                  <me>
                    |\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| \in \{3,5,15\}, |\operatorname{Syl}_3(G)| \in \{4,10\},|\operatorname{Syl}_5(G)| = 6.
                  </me>
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  The next important observation is:
                </p>
          
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    There is no non-trivial action of <m>G</m> on a set <m>S</m> of size at most <m>4</m>.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
          
                <p>
                  For if there was such a non-trivial action, we would get a homomorphism <m>\rho: G \to S_n</m> for <m>2 \leq n \leq 4</m> (if <m>n=1</m>, the only action is the trivial one). 
                  Such a homomorphism cannot be injective by order considerations. 
                  So, it's kernel would be a proper, non-trivial normal subgroup, which do not exist.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  In particular, <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| \ne 3</m> and <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_4(G)| \ne 4</m>, so that 
                  <me>
                    |\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| \in \{5,15\},|\operatorname{Syl}_3(G)| = 10,|\operatorname{Syl}_5(G)| = 6.
                  </me>
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  If <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| = 5</m> then we are done, since this action is transitive and thus certainly non-trivial.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  Suppose <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| = 15</m> and let <m>P_1, \dots, P_{15}</m> be all the Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups. 
                  Since <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_3(G)| = 10</m> and <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_5(G)| = 6</m>, <m>G</m> has <m>10 \cdot 2 + 6 \cdot 4 = 44</m> elements of order <m>3</m> or <m>5</m>. 
                  If <m>P_i \cap P_j = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i \ne j</m>, we would have <m>15 \cdot 3</m> elements of order <m>2</m> or <m>4</m>, which is far too many elements in total. 
                  At least two of these must therefore intersect non-trivially and without loss say <m>H = P_1 \cap P_2</m> has two elements.
                  We consider <m>K = N_G(H)</m>. 
                  As in the preivious example, <m>K \supseteq P_1 \cup P_2</m> and hence <m>|K| \geq 6</m>, <m>4 \mid |K|</m>, and <m>|K| \mid 60</m>. 
                  The possibilities are 
                  <me>
                    |K| = 12, 20, 60.
                  </me> 
                  If <m>|K| = 60</m> then <m>H \unlhd G</m>, which is impossible. 
                  If <m>|K| = 20</m>, then we obtain an transitive action of <m>G</m> on the three element set of left cosets of <m>K</m> in <m>G</m>, which as shown above is not possible. 
                  We are left with <m>|K| = 12</m>. Thus <m>G</m> acts transitively (and hence non-trivially) on the five element set of left cosets of <m>K</m> in <m>G</m>.
                </p>
              </proof>
            </theorem>

            <remark>
              <p>
                The proof shows that <m>G \cong A_5</m> if either <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| = 5</m> or <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| =15</m>, but in hindsight only one of these can actually be possible. 
                It's actually the former: <m>A_5</m> has no elements of order <m>4</m> (since four cycles are odd permuations) and the only elements of order <m>2</m> are products of two disjoint transpotions, and there are <m>15</m> such elements. 
                It's not hard to see that the five <m>4</m>-element subgroups of <m>A_5</m> given by the Klein <m>4</m>-group <m>V := \{e, (1 \, 2)(3 \, 4), (1 \, 3)(2 \, 4), (1 \, 4)(2 \, 3)\}</m> and its obvious conjugates (i.e., those obtained by leaving out one of <m>1,2,3,4</m> instead of <m>5</m>) are the only Sylow <m>2</m>-subgoups of <m>G</m>.

                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>150</m> and suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> is simple. 
                  Notice that <m>150=2\cdot 3\cdot 5^2</m>. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>, we know <m>|\Syl_5(G)|\equiv 1\mod{5}</m> and divides <m>6</m>, the only options are thus <m>1</m> and <m>6</m>. 
                  Since <m>G</m> is simple, there must be exactly <m>n_5=6</m>, where <m>n_5=\Syl_5(G)</m>. 
                  Let <m>G</m> act on <m>\Syl_5(G)</m> by conjugation. 
                  Thus <m>\rho: G\to S_6</m> is a group homomorphism. 
                  Note that <m>|S_6|=720</m>, and that the order of <m>G</m> does not divide <m>720</m>. 
                  By Part (2) of <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> this action is transitive, meaning that the kernel of <m>\rho</m> cannot be trivial.

                  A normal series is called a <em>composition series</em> if each subqoutient <m>N_i/N_{i-1}</m> is a simple group.
                </p>
              </statement>
            </definition>

            <example>
              <p>
                Suppose <m>G = \langle x \rangle</m> is cyclic of order <m>n &gt; 1</m> and say <m>n = p_1 \cdots p_k</m> is a prime factorization of <m>n</m>. 
                Then the factors of 
                <me>\{e\} = \langle x^0 \rangle \unlhd \langle x^{n/p_1} \rangle \unlhd \langle x^{n/p_1p_2} \rangle \unlhd\cdots \unlhd\langle x^{n/p_1p_2 \cdots p_k}\rangle = G</me> 
                are of order <m>p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k</m>, respectively, and hence are all simple groups. 
                Thus the composition factors of <m>G</m> are <me>\mathbb{Z}/p_1, \mathbb{Z}/p_2, \cdots, \mathbb{Z}/p_k.</me>
              </p>
            </example>

            <example>
              <p>
                <m>\{e\} \unlhd\langle r \rangle\unlhd D_{2n}</m> is a normal series. 
                Since <m>\langle r \rangle</m> is cyclic of order <m>n</m>, it has a composition series as in the previous example. 
                By inserting this into the length two normal series given here, we obtain a composition series of <m>D_{2n}</m> with composition factors 
                <me>\mathbb{Z}/2, \mathbb{Z}/p_1, \mathbb{Z}/p_2, \cdots, \mathbb{Z}/p_k.</me>

            <proposition xml:id="prop-solv-1">
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Assume <m>G</m> is a group and <m>N \unlhd G</m>. 
                  If <m>N</m> and <m>G/N</m> both have composition series, then so does <m>G</m>. 
                  Moreover, in this case, the list of composition factors of <m>G</m> is the concatenation of the lists of composition factors of <m>N</m> and <m>G/N</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  This is a consequence of the Isomorphism Theorems. In detail, a composition series for <m>G/N</m> has the form <me>e \unlhd M_1/N \unlhd M_2/N \unlhd\cdots \unlhd M_k/N = G/N</me> where <m>N \unlhd M_1 \unlhd\cdots \unlhd M_k = G</m>. If <m>e \unlhd N_1 \unlhd\cdots \unlhd N_j = N</m> is a composition seires for <m>N</m>, then <me>e \unlhd N_1 \unlhd\cdots \unlhd N_j \unlhd M_1 \unlhd\cdots \unlhd M_k = G</me> is a composition series for <m>G</m> since <m>M_i/M_{i-1} \cong (M_i/N)/(M_{i-1}/N)</m> for all <m>i = 1, \dots, k</m>. (For the case <m>i = 1</m>, interpret <m>M_0</m> as <m>N</m>.)
                </p>
              </proof>
            </proposition>

            <example>
              <p>
                As you showed in the homework, <m>S_4</m> has a normal subgroup <m>V</m> of order <m>4</m>. 
                <m>V</m> has a composition series of the form 
                <me>\{e\} \unlhd\langle (1 2)(3 4) \rangle \unlhd V,</me> 
                and so the composition factors of <m>V</m> are <m>\mathbb{Z}/2, \mathbb{Z}/2</m>.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                The group <m>S_4/V</m> has order <m>6</m> and it has an element of order <m>3</m>, namely <m>(1 2 3)</m>. 
                If <m>G</m> is any group of oder <m>6</m> with an element <m>x</m> or order <m>3</m>, then the composition factors of <m>G</m> are <m>\mathbb{Z}/2, \mathbb{Z}/3</m>. 
                (In fact, every group of order <m>6</m> has an element of order <m>3</m>.) 
                To see this, note that <m>\langle x \rangle</m> is normal in <m>G</m> since it has index two.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                Using the Proposition, the compition factors of <m>S_4</m> are 
                <me>\mathbb{Z}/2, \mathbb{Z}/2, \mathbb{Z}/2, \mathbb{Z}/3.</me>
              </p>
        
              <p>
                We can make this more explicit too. 
                The subgroup of <m>G/N</m> generated by <m>(1 \, 2 \, 3) N</m> corresponds to the subgroup <m>M</m> of <m>G</m> that is generated by the elements of <m>V</m> along with <m>(1 \, 2 \, 3)</m>. 
                We have 
                <me>\{e\} \unlhd\langle (1 2)(3 4) \rangle \unlhd V \unlhd M \unlhd G</me> 
                with factors <m>\mathbb{Z}/2, \mathbb{Z}/2, \mathbb{Z}/3, \mathbb{Z}/2</m>.
              </p>
            </example>

            <example>
              <p>
                The composition factors of <m>S_5</m> are <m>\mathbb{Z}/2</m> and <m>A_5</m>. 
                This holds since <m>A_5 \unlhd S_5</m>, <m>[S_5:A_5] = 2</m>, and <m>A_5</m> is simple, facts that we will prove later.

              We close this subsection with some big-picture type comments. 
              A normal subgroup of a group is analogous to a factor of an integer, and a composition series of a finite group is analogous to a prime factorizations of integers. 
              In this analogy, the role of a prime number is played by a simple group. 
              One major difference is that, unlike for prime factorizations, the list of composition factors of a group do <em>not</em> uniquely determine the group since, for example, <m>D_{2n}</m> and <m>\mathbb{Z}/(2n)</m> (and, for that matter, any solvable group of order <m>2n</m>) have the same composition factors but are certainly not isomorphic.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              Nonetheless, a major motivating idea in finite group theory is the following: 
              In order to know everything about finite group theory, one merely needs to know:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    a complete list of all simple groups and
                  </p>
                </li>
        
                <li>
                  <p>
                    a method of reconstructing all possible finite groups having a given list of composition factors.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
      
            <p>
              The former task was essentially accomplished by the 1980's, when all finite simple groups were classified into a handful of families along with <m>26</m> <q>sporadic</q> simple groups. 
              The latter task is probably not really possible as stated here. 
              But, there is a large collection of properties <m>\mathcal P</m> of finite groups such that if <m>\mathcal P</m> holds for all members of a compostion series of a given group then <m>\mathcal P</m> also holds for the group itself. 
              For such a property <m>\mathcal P</m>, it suffices to check that <m>\mathcal P</m> holds true for every finite simple group. 
              This technique has been used with success.

                        A key result of Galois theory is that a polynomial equation is solvable by radicals (i.e., its roots can be expressed using basic arithmetic operations and roots) if and only if its associated Galois group is solvable. 
                        This result connects group theory directly to classical problems in algebra.

                        In the study of Lie groups, solvable groups often serve as a starting point for understanding more complex groups. 
                        A classic example is the Borel subgroups in the theory of algebraic groups, which are connected solvable groups and play a central role in the classification of algebraic groups.

                      <p>
                        The representations of solvable groups are particularly well-understood due to the fact that these groups have abelian quotients at each level of their derived series. 
                        This allows techniques from the representation theory of abelian groups to be extended to solvable groups.

                        In the classification of <m>3</m>-manifolds, the fundamental group of certain types of 3-manifolds (such as Seifert-fibered spaces) is solvable. 
                        Understanding these groups is crucial for classifying the topology of the manifold.

                  Notice that the hypothesis implies <m>HK\leq G</m>. 
                  Furthermore <m>H\mathrel{\unlhd}G, K\mathrel{\unlhd}G</m> and <m>H\cap K=\{e\}</m> imply that the elements of <m>H</m> commute with the elements of <m>K</m>. 
                  Indeed, consider <m>h\in H,k\in K</m>. 
                  Then since <m>H\mathrel{\unlhd}G</m>, <m>khk^{-1} \in H</m>, so also <m>[k,h]=khk^{-1}h^{-1}\in H</m>. 
                  Similarly it follows that <m>[k,h]\in K</m>, but since <m>H \cap K = \{e\}</m> it follows that <m>[k,h]= e</m>, i.e. <m>hk = kh</m> for any <m>h\in H, k\in K</m>.
                </p>
  
                <p>
                  Using the above we have 
                  <me>
                    \begin{aligned}
                      \theta((h_1, k_1) (h_2, k_2))  
                      &amp; = \theta(h_1h_2, k_1k_2) \\
                      &amp; = h_1h_2k_1k_2 \\
                      &amp; = h_1k_1h_2k_2 = \theta(h_1, k_1) \theta(h_2, k_2)

                  </me> 
                  and thus <m>\theta</m> is a homomorphism. 
                  It's kernel is <m>\{(k,h) \mid k = h^{-1} \}</m>, which is just <m>\{e\}</m> since <m>H \cap K = \{e\}</m>. 
                  The image of <m>\theta</m> is clearly <m>HK</m>. 
                  This proves <m>\theta</m> is an isomorphism.

              Suppose <m>G</m> is a group with subgroups <m>H\mathrel{\unlhd}G</m> and <m>K\leq G</m> such that <m>H\cap K=\{e\}</m>. 
              Then we still have <m>HK\leq G</m>; let's see what we would need the multiplication on the cartesian product <m>H\times K</m> to be in order for <m>\theta: H \times K \to HK</m> defined by <m>\theta(h,k) = hk</m> to still be a group homomorphism: 
              <me>
                \theta(h_1, k_1) \theta(h_2, k_2) = h_1k_1h_2k_2 = h_1h'_2k_1k_2=\theta(h_1h_2',k_1k_2),
              </me>
              where <m>h'_2\in H</m> is such that <m>k_1h_2k_1^{-1}=h'_2</m>.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              This means that we would need to have <m>(h_1, k_1)(h_2, k_2)=(h_1h_2',k_1k_2)</m> for <m>\theta</m> to be a homomorphism. 
              This motivates the following definition.

              Before we prove that the construction above actually gives a group, let's compute a few examples.

                Given <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> we could always take <m>\rho</m> to be the trivial homomorphism, so that <m>\rho(y)(x) = x</m> for all <m>y \in K</m> and <m>x \in H</m>. 
                Then <m>K \rtimes_\rho H</m> is just the usual direct product:

                given by <m>\rho(x)(y) = xyx^{-1}</m> for <m>x \in K, y \in H</m> is a homomorphism. 
                Thus <m>K</m> acts on <m>H</m> via automorphisms.

                Let <m>K = \langle x \rangle</m> be cyclic of order <m>2</m> and <m>H = \langle y \rangle</m> be cyclic of order <m>n</m> for any <m>n \geq 1</m>. 
                There is an automorphism of <m>K</m> that sends <m>y</m> to <m>y^{-1}</m>. 
                This automorphism is its own inverse; i.e., it has order <m>2</m>. 
                Therefore, by <xref ref="prop-ump-cyclic"/>, there is a group homomorphism 
                <me>
                  \rho: K \to \operatorname{Aut}(H)

                with <m>\rho(x)(y) = y^{-1}</m>. 
                We may thus form the group

                  G := H \rtimes_\rho K.
                </me>

                Indeed, by the universal mapping property for <m>D_{2n}</m> we have a homomorphism 
                <me>
                  \theta: D_{2n} \to G
                </me> 
                such that <m>\theta(r) = (y,e_K)</m> and <m>\theta(s) = (x,e_H)</m>. 
                Moreover, <m>\theta</m> is onto since 
                <me>
                  \theta(r^is^j)=(y^i, x^j) \text{ for all } 0 \leq i \leq n-1, 0 \leq j \leq 1
                </me> 
                and since <m>|D_{2n}|=|G|=2n</m> it follows that <m>\theta</m> is a bijection. 
                So the dihedral group is a semidirect product, in which the two component groups are cyclic of orders <m>n</m> and <m>2</m> respectively: 
                <me>
                  D_{2n} \cong \langle y \rangle \rtimes_\rho \langle x \rangle
                </me> 
                and <m>\rho</m> is the inversion homomorphism as described above.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  We have

                    \begin{aligned}
                    \theta((y_1, x_1) (y_2, x_2))  &amp; =

                  and thus <m>\theta</m> is a homomorphism. 
                  It's kernel is <m>\{(y,x) \mid y = x^{-1}, y\in H, x\in K \}</m>, which is just <m>\{e\}</m> since <m>H \cap K = \{e\}</m>. 
                  The image of <m>\theta</m> is clearly <m>KH = G</m>. 
                  This proves <m>\theta</m> is an isomorphism.

                So, <m>G</m> is isomorphic to a semi-direct product, as we already showed.

                It follows that

              It is important to be aware that for a fixed pair of groups <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>, different actions of <m>H</m> on <m>K</m> via automorphisms can result in isomorphic semi-direct products. 
              Indeed, determining when <m>K \rtimes_{\rho} H \cong K \rtimes_{\rho'} H</m> is in general a tricky business. 
              The previous example shows this.
            </p>
  
            <example><title></title>
              <p>
                Let <m>G = S_n</m> and <m>K = A_n</m> again, but this time take <m>H' = \langle (1 \, 3) \rangle = (1 \,2 \, 3) \langle (1 \, 2) \rangle (1 \,2 \, 3)^{-1}</m> (assuming <m>n \geq 3</m>). 
                Then we get 
                <me>
                  S_n \cong A_n \rtimes_{\rho'} C_2
                </me> 
                where <m>C_2 = \langle x \rangle</m> is cyclic of order <m>2</m> and the action <m>\rho': C_2 \to \operatorname{Aut}(A_n)</m> sends <m>x</m> to conjugation by <m>(1 \,3)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The actions <m>\rho</m> and <m>\rho'</m> are not identical. For example, assuming <m>n\geq 4</m> we have 
                <me>
                  \rho(x)(1 \, 2) (1 \, 2) (3 \, 4) = (1 \, 2) (3 \, 4) \text { maps } 1\mapsto 2
                </me> 
                and 
                <me>
                  \rho'(x)(1 \, 2) (3 \, 4) = (1 \, 3) (1 \, 2) (3 \, 4) (1 \, 3) \text { maps } 1\mapsto 4.
                </me> 
                Yet 
                <me>
                  A_n \rtimes_{\rho} H \cong A_n \rtimes_{\rho'} H'
                </me> 
                since each is isomorphic to <m>S_n</m>.

              <p>
                On HW 8 you will give a more conceptual reason for why these two semidirect products turned out to be isomorphic: it is because <m>H</m> and <m>H'</m> are conjugate in <m>S_n</m>. 
                More generally, below is a criterion for a two semidirect products to be isomorphic.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>6</m>. 
                  <xref text="title" ref="thm-cayley"/> gives that there exist elements <m>x,y\in G</m> with <m>|x|=2</m> and <m>|y|=3</m>. 
                  Let <m>K=\langle x \rangle</m> and <m>H=\langle y\rangle</m>. 
                  Since <m>[G:H]=2</m>, <m>H</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m> and since <m>H\cap K</m> is a common subgroup of <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> gives that <m>|H\cap K|\mid \operatorname{gcd}(|H|,|K|)=1</m>. 
                  Thus <m>H\cap K=\{e\}</m> and since <m>|HK|=\frac{|H||K|}{|H\cap K|}=6=|G|</m> we deduce that <m>HK=G</m>. 
                  <xref ref="thm-sdp-recognition"/> now gives that <m>G</m> is the internal semidirect product of <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>. 
                  More to the point, <m>G\cong H\rtimes_\rho K</m>, where <m>\rho:K\to \operatorname{Aut}(H)</m> gives the action of <m>K</m> on <m>H</m> by <xref text="title" ref="ex-conj"/>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  We now analyze the possibilities for <m>\rho</m>. 
                  By <xref ref="prop-aut-cn" />, <m>\operatorname{Aut}(H)\cong\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}/3)\cong (\mathbb{Z}/3^\times, \cdot)=(\{\pm 1\},\cdot)</m>. 
                  There are two possibilities for the image of <m>\rho</m>: either <m>\operatorname{Im}(\rho)=\{\text{id}_H\}</m> or <m>\operatorname{Im}(\rho)=\operatorname{Aut}(H)</m>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  If <m>\operatorname{Im}(\rho)=\{\text{id}_H\}</m>, then <m>\rho(x)=c_x=\text{id}_H</m> (which implies <m>xy=yx</m>) and <m>H\rtimes_\rho K=H\times K</m>. 
                  Therefore, in this case <m>G\cong H\times K\cong C_3\times C_2\cong C_6</m>, where the last isomorphism uses the <xref text="title" ref="thm-sunzi"/>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  If <m>\operatorname{Im}(\rho)=\operatorname{Aut}(H)</m>, then <m>\rho(x)</m> is the map <m>y^i\mapsto y^{-1}</m> and by an earlier example for this <m>\rho</m> we have <m>H\rtimes_\rho K\cong D_6</m>, so <m>G\cong D_6</m>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  Finally, <m>C_6\not \cong D_6</m> because the former is abelian and the latter is not.

                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>pq</m> and let <m>H, K</m> be Sylow subgroups of order <m>q</m> and <m>p</m> respectively. 
                  We see that <m>H</m> is a normal subgroup using <xref ref="thm-smallest-prime-normal"/>, since <m>[G:H]=p</m> is the smallest prime that divides <m>|G|</m>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  Furthermore, since <m>H\cap K</m> is a subgroup of both <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> we have by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> that <m>|H\cap K|\mid \operatorname{gcd}(q,p)=1</m>, so that <m>H\cap K=\{e_G\}</m>. 
                  From here it follows that 
                  <me>
                    |HK|=\frac{|H||K|}{|H\cap K|}=\frac{q\cdot p}{1}=pq=|G|

                  for some homomorphism <m>\rho: K \to \operatorname{Aut}(H)</m>, equivalently <m>\rho: C_p \to \operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m>. 
                  By <xref ref="prop-ump-cyclic" /> to give such a homomorphism <m>\rho</m> is equivalent to giving an element <m>z\in \operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m> so that <m>z^p=\text{id}</m>, which will give <m>\rho(y^j)=z^j</m> for <m>C_p=\langle y\rangle</m>. 
                  Thus <m>|z|\mid p</m> yielding that either <m>|z|=1</m> or <m>|z|=p</m>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  <em>Case 1:</em> if <m>|z|=1</m> then <m>\rho</m> is the trivial homomorphism and thus <m>G\cong C_q\times C_p\cong C_{pq}</m>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  <em>Case 2:</em> if <m>|z|=p</m> then it must be the case by Lagrange that <m>p\mid |\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m>. 
                  By <xref ref="cor-aut-cp" /> we know that <m>\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)\cong C_{p-1}</m> is a cyclic group. 
                  Therefore we have that <m>p\mid (q-1)</m> if and only if there exists an element <m>z\in \operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m> of order <m>p</m> by <xref ref="thm-cyclic-divisors-and-subgroups" /> (2).
                  Moreover any such element <m>z</m> generates a subgroup of <m>\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m> of order <m>p</m>. 
                  Since there is a unique subgroup of a cyclic group of a given order by <xref ref="thm-cyclic-divisors-and-subgroups" /> (2) we see that the image of <m>\rho</m> is independent of the choice of <m>z</m>. 
                  Thus by <xref ref="thm-conjugate-aut" /> we conclude that all subgroups resulting from any choice of <m>z</m> of order <m>p</m> are isomorphic.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  Moreover, from the explicit presentation of semidirect products of cyclic groups given in a homework problem we see that the resulting group is non-abelian; 
                  in particular it is not isomorphic to <m>C_{pq}</m>.

            <proof>
              <p>
                Using <xref ref="prop-ump-cyclic"/>, we let <m>\psi: \mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}/(p_1^{e_1}) \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}/(p_l^{e_l})</m> be the unique homomorhism that sends <m>1</m> to <m>([1]_{{p_1}^{e_1}}, \cdots, [1]_{{p_l}^{e_l}})</m>.

                Conversely, if <m>\psi(n) = 0</m>, then <m>p_i^{e_i} \mid n</m> for all <m>i</m> and since <m>p_1^{e_1}, \dots, p_l^{e_l}</m> are pairwise relatively prime, it follows that <m>m \mid n</m>. 
                This proves <m>\operatorname{ker}(\psi) = \langle m \rangle</m>.

              Sunzi's Remainder Theorem frequently goes by the name of The Chinese Remainder Theorem, but it has been remarked that this is somewhat like referencing the Pythagorean Theorem as The Greek Triangle Theorem or Fermat's Little Theorem as The French Power Postulate. 
              In the interest of giving credit where credit is due, we include it here with the name of the 3rd-century Chinese mathematician, Sunzi, to whom the result is often attributed.

                It suffices prove that for a given group <m>G</m>, we can recover its invariant factor form from its elementary divisor form, and vice versa.

                We will have that <m>d_2\mid d_1</m> and in general that <m>d_{i+1}\mid d_i</m> since by definition the exponent of <m>p_j\in d_i</m> is greater or equal to the exponent of <m>p_j\in d_{i+1}</m>.

              Let <m>G</m> be an abelian group of order <m>75</m>.

                |(a,b,c)=\operatorname{lcm}(|a|, |b|, |c|)\leq 15
              </me> 
              since <m>|a|, |b|\in\{1,5\}</m> and <m>|c|\in\{1,3\}</m>.

              Alternatively we could argue that the uniqueness of the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftfgag"/> tells us that <m>G</m> uniquely determines the elementary divisors, so two groups with distinct elementary divisors cannot be isomorphic.

                      Then <m>R^{op}</m> is also a ring

              We will spend the first half of our exploration of rings following the same general structure as we did in <xref text="title" ref="part-group"/>. 
              First, we looked at rings in general, and now we will examine subrings, just as we did with subgroups. 
              Then it's off to homomorphisms, isomorphisms, and quotients.

                <p>
                  Both <m>\Q(\sqrt {d})</m> and <m>\Z[\sqrt{d}]</m> are closed under subtraction and multiplication, so they are subrings of <m>\C</m>.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  The fact that <m>\Q(\sqrt {d})</m> is a {} follows since <m>\Q(\sqrt {d})</m> is also closed under taking inverses. 
                  Indeed the inverse of <m>r + q \sqrt{d}</m> (from <m>\C</m>) turns out to be 
                  <me> 
                    (r + q \sqrt{d})^{-1} = \frac{r - q \sqrt{d}}{r^2 - d q^2} \in \Q(\sqrt {d})
                  </me> 
                  whenever <m>r + q \sqrt{d}\neq 0</m>. 
                  A slightly subtle point here is that the fraction above makes sense since <m>r^2 -d q^2 \ne 0</m> provided <m>r</m> and <m>q</m> are not simultaneously <m>0</m>. 
                  This is because, if <m>r^2 -d q^2 = 0</m> then either <m>d=(r/q)^2</m>, which contradicts the assumption that <m>d</m> is squarefree, or <m>r=q=0</m>, which contradicts the assumption <m>r + q \sqrt{d}\neq 0</m>.
                </p>
              </proof>
            </lemma>
    
            <remark>
              <p>
                Note the difference in notation between <m>\Q(\sqrt d)</m> and <m>\Z[\sqrt d]</m>: one uses parenthesis and the other brackets. 
                This is to denote that one (the one with parentheses) is a field, whereas the other [the one with brackets] is not. 
                This is also some spicy foreshadowing that won't pay off until all the way down in <xref text="title" ref="part-fields"/>.

            <theorem xml:id="thm-units-in-fields"><title>Units in Fields</title>
              <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field. 
                Prove that every non-zero element of <m>F</m> is a unit. 
                In symbols, show <m>F^\times=F\setminus\{0\}</m>.
              </p>
            </theorem>

            <remark>
              <p>
                <xref ref="thm-units-in-fields"/> is often the standard way of proving that something is a field.

            <p>
              If you'll remember all the way back to <xref ref="ex-group-of-units"/>, you'll see that we verified <xref ref="thm-units-in-fields"/> for <m>\Q,\R,</m> and <m>\C</m>. 
              This also explains why <m>\Z^\times</m> and <m>\Z/n^\times</m> had a different structure: they weren't fields.
            </p>

            <example xml:id="zp-field"><title><m>\Z/p</m> is a Field!</title>
              <p>
                In <xref ref="exe-group-of-units-in-zp"/> we showed that <m>\Z/p^\times=\Z/p\sm\{0\}</m>. 
                Thus <m>\Z/p</m> is a field for all primes <m>p</m>.
              </p>

            <exercise xml:id="exe-matrices-and-units"><title>Matrices and Units</title>
              <p>
                For any field <m>F</m> we have <m>\operatorname{M}_{n}(F)^\times = \operatorname{GL}_n(F)</m>.

            <p>
              A group ring is an algebraic structure that combines concepts from group theory and ring theory. 
              It is constructed by "attaching" a ring to a group, allowing you to study the group's structure using ring-like operations.
            </p>

            <definition xml:id="def-group-ring">
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G = (G, \cdot)</m> be a group and let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with <m>1\neq 0</m> (often <m>R</m> is taken to be a field). 
                  Let <m>R[G]</m> be the collection of formal expressions of the form indicated below, where the <m>+</m> operation is assumed to be commutative: 
                  <me>
                    R[G]=\left\{r_1 g_1 + r_2 g_2 + \dots + r_n g_n, n \geq 0, r_i \in R, g_i \in G\right\}.
                  </me> 
                  Equivalently, a typical element of <m>R[G]</m> can be written as <m>\sum_{g \in G} r_g g</m>, where <m>r_g \in R</m> for all <m>g</m> and <m>r_g = 0</m> for all but a finite number of <m>g</m>'s.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  We can make <m>R[G]</m> into a ring by defining 
                  <me>(\sum_{g \in G} r_g g) +(\sum_{g \in G} s_g g) = \sum_{g \in G}  (r_g+ s_g) g</me> 
                  and 
                  <me>(\sum_{g \in G}  r_g g) \cdot (\sum_{h \in G}  s_h h) = \sum_{z \in G}  \sum_{(g,h), gh = z} r_g s_h z.</me>
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  With these definitions, <m>R[G]</m> is a ring, called the <em>group ring of <m>G</m></em> with coefficients in <m>R</m>. 
                  It is a unital ring with identity <m>1_Re_G</m>. 
                  If <m>R=F</m> is a field then <m>F[G]</m> is an <m>F</m>-vector space.

              <p>
                Some authors write <m>R[G]</m> as <m>RG</m>, but the notation <m>R[G]</m> is more standard.

                  Let <m>R</m> be any commutative ring and <m>G</m> a group. 
                  Then <m>R[G]</m> is commutative if and only if <m>G</m> is abelian.
                </p>
              </statement>
            </proposition>

            <example>
              <p>
                Let <m>Q_8 = \{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}</m> denote the group of quaterinons and <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m> the field of real numbers, and let us consider the group ring <m>{\mathbb{R}}[Q_8]</m>. 
                Actually, the notation here is not so good since <m>(-1) k</m> is easily confused with <m>1 (-k)</m>, and, even worse, things like <m>1 \cdot 1</m>, <m>1 \cdot (-1)</m> are highly confusing. 
                So, let us rename the elements of <m>Q</m>, so that <me>Q_8 = \{e, e', i, i', j, j', k, k'\}</me> so that <m>e</m> is what we were writing as <m>1</m>, <m>e'</m> is what we were writing as <m>-1</m>, <m>i'</m> is what we were writing as <m>-i</m>, etc. 
                So, for example, we now have <m>i^2 = e'</m> in this group.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                <m>{\mathbb{R}}[Q_8]</m> is a non-commutative ring, and you might guess that it is the same as the quaterinons <m>\mathbb{H}</m> defined above, but it can't be: 
                <m>{\mathbb{R}}[Q_8]</m> is <m>8</m>-dimensional as a <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m>-vector space whereas <m>\mathbb{H}</m> is <m>4</m> dimensional. 
                In fact <m>{\mathbb{R}}[Q_8]</m> is not a division ring, since it has zero divisors: <m>(e - i)(e + i + i^2 + i^3) =0</m> and so neither of the two factors can be units.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                The problem is that <m>(-1) e \in R[Q_8]</m> is <em>not</em> the same thing as <m>1 e'\in R[Q]</m>, but we want them to be the same in <m>\mathbb{H}</m>. 
                Once we learn about quotient rings, we will be able to show that <m>\mathbb{H}</m> is the quotient of <m>R[Q_8]</m> by the ideal generated by <m>e' + e</m>. 
                Roughly this means we mod out by the relation <m>e' \sim -e</m> and all consequences of this relation. 
                For example, once one imposes this equivalence relation, the element 
                <me>e + i + i^2 + i^3 = e + i + e' + e' i = (e + e') + i(e + e')</me> 
                becomes the zero element.

               Take <m>G = S_3</m> and <m>R = {\mathbb{R}}</m>.

An element is any expression of the form <me>r_1e + r_2  (1 \, 2) + r_3 (1 \, 3) + r_4 (2 \, 3) + r_5  (1 \, 2 \, 3) + r_6 (1 \, 3 \, 2)</me> where <m>r_1, \dots, r_6</m> are real numbers. This ring has some zero divisors â for example <me>(e - (1 \, 2))(e + (1 \, 2)) = e - (1 \, 2) + (1 \, 2) - (1 \, 2)^2 = e - e = 0.</me> Here we are abusing notation a bit â for example, <m>- (1 \, 2)</m> is really <m>(-1_R) (1 \, 2)</m>. In general, <m>1_R g</m> is just written as <m>g</m> in <m>R[G]</m> and <m>(-r)g</m> is just written as <m>- rg</m>, since <m>(-r)g</m> is the additive inverse of <m>rg</m>.

              We identify <m>G</m> as a subset of <m>R[G]</m> in the obvious way (by identifying <m>1_R g</m> with <m>g</m>).
            </p>
    
            <p>
              This gives that for any <m>g\in G</m> we have <me>(1_R g)(1_R g^{-1}) =(1_R g^{-1})(1_R g) =1_R e_G=1_{R[G]},</me> thus <m>i(g)</m> is a unit in <m>R[G]</m> with inverse <m>i(g^{-1})</m>.

            <p>
              The formula <m>(1_R g)(1_R h) = 1_R (gh)</m> also gives that the map <m>g\mapsto 1_Rg</m> is group homomorphism.Â â»

                        The group ring <m>R[G]</m> acts on vector spaces, allowing one to study how groups can be represented by linear transformations. 
                        This is fundamental for studying symmetries and representations of finite and infinite groups.
                        A representation of <m>G</m> on a vector space <m>V</m> can be viewed as a module over the group ring <m>R[G]</m>, which means that <m>V</m> becomes a left <m>R[G]</m>-module, and the action of <m>gâG</m> on a vector in <m>V</m> corresponds to multiplication by <m>g</m> as an element of <m>R[G]</m>.

                Group rings give lots of cool examples of rings, but we will now just focus on the boring case when <m>G</m> is a free abelian group (written with multiplicative notation) generated by <m>x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n</m>. 
                In this case an element of <m>G</m> may be written uniquely as <m>x_1^{e_1}, \dots, x_n^{e_n}</m> for <m>e_1, \dots, e_n \in\mathbb{Z}</m>. 
                For any commutative ring <m>R</m> a typical element of <m>R[G]</m> is thus 
                <me>\sum_{e_1, \dots, e_n \in \mathbb{Z}} r_{e_1, \dots, e_n} x_1^{e_1} x_2^{e_2} \cdots x_n^{e_n}</me> 
                This is a <em>Laurent polynomial</em> in the variables <m>x_1, \dots, x_n</m> with <m>R</m>-coefficients. 
                Say <m>n = 1</m> and let <m>x = x_1</m>, so that <m>G = \langle x \rangle</m>. 
                Then <m>a x^{-3} + b x^{1} + c + dx^5</m> with <m>a,b,c,d \in R</m> is a representative example of an element of <m>R[G]</m>. 
                Addition is by combining like powers of <m>x</m>. 
                Multiplication is uniquely determined by the fact that it must satisfy the distributive law and <m>x^i x^j = x^{i +j}</m> for <m>i, j \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.

The <em>polynomial ring</em> on <m>n</m> variables <m>x_1,\ldots,x_n</m> with coefficients in <m>R</m> is the monoid ring <m>R[x_1,...,x_n] = R(\mathbb{N}^n)</m> on the free abelian monoid <m>\mathbb{N}^n</m> where each <m>x_i</m> is identified with <m>(0,\ldots, 0,1,0,\ldots, 0)</m> with the 1 in the <m>i</m>-th position.

              <em>Remark 2.24</em>.  When <m>R = {\mathbb{R}}</m>, one is tempted to think of <m>{\mathbb{R}}[x]</m> as being a subring of the ring <m>\mathcal C({\mathbb{R}})</m> of continuous, real-valued functions that are defined on all of <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m>. 
              This is not technically true: elements of <m>{\mathbb{R}}[x]</m> are just formal expressions, not functions. 
              But there is an injective ring homomorphism (see below) 
              <me>{\mathbb{R}}[x] \hookrightarrow\mathcal C({\mathbb{R}})</me> 
              given by identifying a polynomial expression in one variable <m>x</m> having <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m> coefficients with a function in the usual way.

                  Let's observe first that if such a map exists it is unique. For if <m>\tilde\phi: R[x_1, \dots, x_n] \to S</m> is a ring map extending <m>\phi</m> and sending <m>x_i</m> to <m>s_i</m>. Then <me>\begin{aligned*}

                    \end{aligned*}</me> using that <m>\tilde\phi</m> preserves <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For existence, let's assume <m>n = 1</m> at first. Given <m>\phi: R \to S</m> and <m>s \in S</m>, define <me>
                  \tilde{\phi}: R[x] \to S

                  \tilde{\phi}(\sum_i r_i x^i) = \sum_i \phi(r_i) s^i.
                  </me> It is elementary (but tedious) to check <m>\tilde{\phi}</m> really is a ring homomorphism. The fact that it restricts to <m>\phi</m> is clear, however.

                  For the general case, we proceed by induction on the number of variables <m>n</m>. The induction hypothesis shows that there is a ring homomorphism <me>

                  </me> such that <m>\psi|_R = \phi</m> and <m>\psi(x_i) = s_i</m>, <m>i = 1, \dots, n-1</m>. Applying the <m>n=1</m> case to <m>\psi</m> gives <me>
                  \tilde{\psi}: (R[x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}])[x_n] \to S

              <p>
                We often refer to prime ideals as just <q>primes</q>, this will become gently confusing later and we will avoid doing so when possible.

                    The maximal ideals are the ideals generated by prime integers.

                    In <m>\Z[i]</m> the ideal <m>\igen{13}</m> is not prime, because <m>13=(3+2i)(3-2i)\in\igen{13}</m>, but <m>3+2i\not \in \igen{13}</m> and <m>3-2i\not \in \igen{13}</m> 
                    (because if <m>3\pm2i=13\a</m> then <m>N(3\pm2i)=N(13)N(\a)</m> so <m>13=13^2N(\a)</m>, a contradiction).

                  If <m>(r + I)(r' + I) = 0 + I</m>, then <m>rr' \in I</m> and hence either <m>r \in I</m> or <m>r' \in I</m>, so that either <m>r + I = 0</m> or <m>r'+ I = 0</m>. 
                  This proves <m>R/I</m> is a domain. 
                  Suppose <m>R/I</m> is a domain and that <m>xy \in I</m>. 
                  Then <m>(x + I)(y + I) = 0</m> in <m>R/I</m> and hence either <m>x+ I = 0</m> or <m>y + I = 0</m>. 
                  It follows <m>x \in I</m> or <m>y \in I</m>, so that <m>I</m> is prime.

                  For <m>x \in U</m> and <m>r \in R</m>, we have <m>x \in L</m> for some <m>L \in \cT</m> and hence <m>rx \in L \subseteq M</m>.

                  This proves <m>U</m> is an ideal that contains <m>I</m>. 
                  Since every <m>L\in\cT</m> is a proper ideal, <m>L\cap R^\times =\emptyset</m>, so <m>U\cap R^\times = \bigcup_{L \in \cT} L\cap R^\times=\emptyset</m> and hence <m>U</m> is a proper ideal, so <m>U\in\cC</m>. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/>, we conclude <m>\cC</m> has at least one maximal element <m>M</m>. 
                  This is a maximal ideal in the sense of definition  since if <m>J</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m> and <m>M\subseteq J</m> then either <m>J=R</m> or, if <m>J</m> is proper, then <m>J\in \cC</m>, which yields <m>J=M</m> by using that <m>M</m> is a maximal element of <m>\cC</m>.

                <p>
                  The existence of a maximal ideal follows by applying the first part of the theorem for <m>I=(0)</m>.

          <p>
            In a Euclidean domain, division with remainder is possible, and the remainder is always smaller than the divisor. 
            This property is similar to the <xref text="title" ref="thm-division-algorithm"/> for integers, which is what makes Euclidean domains so useful in number theory and algebra.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lets take a look at some examples to deepen our understanding.
          </p>

          <example xml:id="ex-trivial-norm"><title>Trivial Norm</title>
            <p>
              A "degenerate example" is a field <m>F</m> equipped with the trivial norm <m>N(r) = 0</m> for all <m>r</m>. 
              Given <m>a,b \in F</m> with <m>b \ne 0</m>, we have <m>a =(ab^{-1})b + 0</m>. 
              Note that in this example there is no need to include <m>r=0</m> in the description of the <xref text="title" ref="thm-division-algorithm"/>, since <m>b \ne 0</m> implies <m>|0| &lt; |b|</m>. 
              This is not the case in other examples. 
              Also observe that as we've defined remainders they are <em>not</em> unique. 
              For example, in dividing <m>13</m> by <m>5</m>, both 
              <me>
                13 = 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \text{ and } 13 = 3 \cdot 5 + (- 2)
              </me> 
              are considered valid. 
              This calculation shows, more generally, that if <m>b</m> is a unit, then for all <m>a</m> there exists an equation <m>a = bq + r</m> with <m>r = 0</m>, not matter what norm <m>N</m> is used. 
              One could make remainders (and hence quotients) unique for <m>\Z</m> by insisting that remainders always be non-negative, but this is not part of the abstract theory since it doesn't generalize to all cases well.
            </p>
          </example>

          <example xml:id="ex-degree-and-norm"><title>Polynomial Rings over Fields are Euclidean Domains</title>
            <p>
              The next classical example is <m>F[x]</m> with <m>F</m> a field and where we define the norm to be polynomial degree: <m>N(f(x)) = \deg(f(x))</m> if <m>f\neq 0</m> and <m>N(0)=0</m>. 
              This ring is a Euclidean Domain because of the familiar long division for polynomials, as proved in <xref ref="thm-polynomial-division-algorithm"/>.
            </p>
          </example>
          
          <example xml:id="ex-gaussian-integers-are-an-ed"> <title>Guassian Integers are a Euclidean Domain</title>
            <p>
              The ring <m>R = \Z[i]</m> of Gaussian integers is a Euclidean domain with <m>N</m> being the usual complex (Euclidean) square norm <m>N(a+bi)=a^2+b^2</m>. 
              Let <m>\alpha</m>, <m>\beta</m> <m>\in \Z[i]</m> and let <m>\frac{\alpha}{\beta}=p+qi \in \Q(i)</m> 
              (here we use that the fraction field of <m>\Z[i]</m> is <m>\Q(i)</m>). 
              Now pick <m>s,t\in\Z</m> so that <m>|p-s|\leq 1/2</m> and <m>|q-t|\leq 1/2</m>. 
              We have 
              <me>
                \a=\beta(s+ti)+\beta(p+qi)-\beta(s+ti).
              </me> 
              Set <m>q=s+ti</m> and set <m>r=\beta(p+qi)-\beta(s+ti)=\beta(s+ti-(p+qi))</m> and notice that <m>q\in \Z[i]</m> because <m>s,t\in\Z</m> and <m>r\in \Z[i]</m> by closure. 
              If <m>r=0</m> we're good, and if <m>r\neq 0</m> then, using that the complex squared norm is multiplicative as well as the Pythagorean Theorem and the choice for <m>s,t</m>, we have 
              <me>
                N(r)=N(\beta(s+ti-(p+qi)))=N(\beta)N(s+ti-(p+qi))\leq N(\beta)\cdot(1/4+1/4)&lt;N(\beta).
              </me> 
              Thus the norm function <m>N</m> makes <m>\Z[i]</m> into a Euclidean domain.

                  Pick an ideal <m>I</m>. 
                  If <m>I</m> is the zero ideal, <m>I = \igen0</m>.

                  I claim <m>I = \igen b</m>. 
                  It is clear that <m>\igen b \subseteq I</m>.

                  Similarly <m>y = xs</m> and hence <m>y = yus</m>. 
                  Since <m>R</m> is a domain, either <m>y = 0</m> or <m>su = 1</m>. 
                  If <m>y= 0</m>, then <m>x = 0 = 1 y</m> and otherwise <m>u</m> is a unit.

            Most rings that commutative algebraists naturally want to study are noetherian. 
            Noetherian rings are named after Emmy Noether, who is in many ways the mother of modern commutative algebra.

              <p>
                If <m>R</m> is a noetherian integral domain, then every non-zero, not-unit element factors into a finite product of irreducible elements.
              </p>
            </statement>
    
            <proof>
              <p>
                Pick <m>x \in R</m> with <m>x \ne 0</m> and <m>x \notin R^\times</m>. 
                If <m>x</m> is irreducible, there is nothing to prove. 
                Otherwise, we have <m>x = x_1 x_2</m> for non-units <m>x_1, x_2</m>. 
                If both <m>x_1, x_2</m> are irreducible, the proof is complete. 
                Otherwise, one or both of them factors non-trivially. 
                We may express this conveniently by saying that <m>x_1 = x_3x_4</m> and <m>x_2 = x_5x_6</m> such that either <m>x_3</m> and <m>x_4</m> are both non-units or <m>x_5</m> and <m>x_6</m> are both non-units. 
                (E.g., if <m>x_2</m> is irreducible, we could set <m>x_5 = x_2, x_6 = 1</m>.) 
                Continuing in the this manner, we form a binary tree with <m>x</m> at the top, <m>x_1, x_2</m> one level down, <m>x_3,x_4,x_5,x_6</m> one level below that, etc.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                We halt the process of building the tree if at some stage all the leaves of the tree are irreducible elements, at which point we will have proven that <m>x</m> factors in to a product of the irreducible elements given by these leaves.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                We need to rule out the possibility that the process never terminates. 
                If it never terminates, we will have built an infinite binary tree with the property that some route downward through the tree consists of an infinite list of irreducible elements <m>y_1, y_2, y_3,\dots</m> such that <m>x = y_1z_1</m> for a non-unit <m>z_1</m> and, for each <m>i \geq 1</m>, <m>y_{i} = y_{i+1} z_{i+1}</m> for a non-unit <m>z_{i+1}</m>. 
                Since <m>R</m> is an integral domain, we have <m>(x) \subsetneq (y_1)</m> and <m>(y_i) \subsetneq (y_{i+1})</m> for all <m>i \geq 1</m>. 
                (E.g., if <m>(x) = (y_1)</m> then <m>y_1 = xv</m> and hence <m>x = xvz_1</m>, so that <m>vz_1 = 1</m>, contrary to <m>z_1</m> being a non-unit.)
              </p>
    
              <p>
                But then we have arrived at an infinite ascending chain of ideals in <m>R</m>, 
                <me>
                  (x) \subsetneq (y_1) \subsetneq (y_2) \subsetneq (y_3) \subsetneq \cdots,
                </me> 
                which is not possible in a Noetherian ring.

          <remark>
            <p>
              For those mathematicians who refute the Axiom of Choice (though they are few and far between), noetherian rings provide a haven of sorts within the world of algebra. 
              This is because the existence of a maximal ideal is guarenteed in noetherian rings, given that every ascending chain of ideals stabilizes.

                If <m>R</m> is an integral domain and <m>S</m> is a multiplicatively closed subset of nonzerodivisors, the rules given in the above definition for <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> make <m>S^{-1} R</m> into a field. 
                Moreover, the function <m>R\to S^{-1}R</m> sending <m>r</m> to <m>\frac{r}{1}</m> is an injective ring homomorphism.
              </p>
            </statement>
    
            <proof>
              <p>
                There is a lot of small things to check and we'll just do a few. 
                Right off the bat we need to be sure the given equivalence relation really is one. 
                The reflexive and symmetric properties are clear. 
                But the proof of transitivity illustrates a key point: 
                Say <m>\frac{r}{s} \sim \frac{r'}{s'} \sim \frac{r''}{s''}</m>. 
                Then <m>rs'= r's</m> and <m>r's'' = r''s'</m>. 
                We need to deduce that <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. 
                The given equations imply <m>rs's'' = r'ss'' = r''ss'</m> and since <m>s'</m> is a nonzerodivisor we conclude <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. 
                This is in fact the only time that the fact that <m>S</m> consists of nonzerodivisors is used.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                We also need to be sure our rules for <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> make sense and are independent of representation. 
                They <q>make sense</q> since we assume <m>S</m> is closed under <m>\cdot</m>. 
                To show <m>+</m> is independent of representations, say <m>\frac{r}{s} \sim \frac{r''}{s''}</m>, so that <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. 
                Then 
                <me>
                  \frac{r}{s} + \frac{r'}{s'} := \frac{rs' + r's}{ss'}
                </me> and 
                <me>
                  \frac{r''}{s''} + \frac{r'}{s'} := \frac{r''s' + r's''}{s''s'}
                </me> 
                and so we need to show <m>(rs' + r's)(s''s') \sim (r''s' + r's'')(ss')</m>. 
                This is clear upon expaning out both sides and using <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. 
                In a similar way one shows <m>\cdot</m> is well-defined.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                From now on we just write <m>=</m> instead of <m>\sim</m> when dealing with fractions.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                The associative and distributive axioms involve a straightfoward but tedious check, and we skip them entirely. 
                The fact that <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> are commutative is clear from their definitions. 
                The set <m>S^{-1}R</m> is a group under addition since it has a <m>0</m> element, namely <m>\frac{0}{1}</m>, and <m>\frac{r}{s} +\frac{-r}{s} = \frac{rs - rs}{s^2} = \frac{0}{s^2} = \frac{0}{1}</m>, with the last equality holding since <m>0 \cdot 1 = s^2 \cdot 0</m>. 
                The <m>1</m> element is <m>\frac{1}{1}</m>. 
                (Note that we have used that <m>1 \in S</m> a couple times here â indeed, without this assumption <m>S</m> could be empty and then <m>S^{-1}R</m> would be the empty set.)
              </p>
    
              <p>
                <m>R</m> being a domain means <m>xy=0</m> implies (<m>x=0</m> or <m>y=0</m>). 
                The contrapositive to this statement is: 
                if <m>x\neq 0</m> and <m>y\neq 0</m> then <m>xy\neq 0</m>, which shows <m>S</m> is a multiplicatively closed set of nonzerodivisors.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                It remains only to show every non-zero element of <m>S^{-1}R</m> is a unit. 
                Given <m>\frac{r}{s} \ne 0</m>, note that <m>r \ne 0</m> and hence <m>r \in S</m>. 
                So <m>\frac{s}{r}</m> is also an element of <m>S^{-1}R</m>. 
                We have <m>\frac{r}{s} \frac{s}{r} = \frac{sr}{sr} = \frac{1}{1}</m>, where the last equation holds by the definition of <m>\sim</m>.

              <p>
                The fact that <m>r \mapsto \frac{r}{1}</m> is a ring homomorphism is straightforward to check. 
                It's injective since <m>\frac{r}{1} = \frac{0}{1}</m> implies <m>r = 0</m>.

          <p>
            For those of us who remember at least a little linear algebra, modules are generalizations of a vector spaces, but instead of using scalars from a field (like real or complex numbers), we allow scalars to come from a ring (which can be more complicated, like integers or polynomials).
            In short, modules are like "vector spaces with more structure" that allow us to work with rings instead of just fields, unlocking deeper connections in algebra, number theory, and beyond.

            <p>
              Modules are a generalization of the concept of a vector space to any ring of scalars. 
              But while vector spaces make for a great first example of modules, many of the basic facts we are used to from linear algebra are often a little more subtle over a general ring. 
              These differences are features, not bugs. 
              We will introduce modules, study some general linear algebra, and discuss the differences that make the general theory of modules richer and even more fun.

              Typically, one first encounters modules in an undergraduate linear algebra course: the vector spaces from linear algebra are modules over fields. 
              Later, we will see that vector spaces are much simpler modules than modules over other rings. 
              So while one might take linear algebra and vector spaces as an inspiration for what to expect from a module, be warned that this perspective can often be deceiving.

              <p>
                For non-commutative rings, left and right modules are not the same: 
                trying to make a left <m>R</m>-module <m>M</m> into a right one by setting <m>mr = rm</m> fails to satisfy the second axiom, since <m>m(rs) = (rs)m</m> and <m>(mr)s = (rm)s = s(rm) = (sr)m</m>, and, unless <m>rs =sr</m>, we cannot conclude that <m>m(rs) = (mr)s</m>.

              For an <m>R</m>-module <m>M</m> the ring <m>R</m> is often referred to as the <q>ring of scalars</q> for the module (by analogy to the vector space case). 
              Given an action of a ring of scalars on a module, we can sometimes produce an action of a different ring of scalars on the same set, producing in effect a new module structure.

                When working with groups, it was necessary that we modded out by a normal subgroup in order to ensure that our quotient group was well defined.
                However, since all modules underlying groups are abelian, this condition is satisfied automatically.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Among the many things to check here, we will only check a couple.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  We need to prove the rule for scaling by <m>R</m> on <m>M/N</m> is well-defined: 
                  If <m>m+N=m'+N</m> then <m>m-m'\in N</m> so <m>r(m-m')\in N</m> by the definition of submodule.
                  This gives that <m>rm-rm'\in N</m>, hence <m>rm+N=rm'+N</m>. 
                  The module axioms are then pretty straightforward. 
                  We already know from 817 CITEX that <m>M/N</m> is an abelian group under <m>+</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Let us check one of the four axioms involving scaling. 
                  We have 
                  <me>
                    r( (m_1 +N) + (m_2 +N)) = r((m_1 + m_2) + N) = (r(m_1+m_2)) + N = (rm_1 + rm_2) + N = (rm_1 + N) + (rm_2 + N),
                  </me> 
                  which gives the third such axiom. 
                  The other three are also straightforward.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  The fact that <m>\pi</m> is an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism is also straightforward. 
                  Its kernel is <m>\{m \in M \mid m + N = N\}</m>, which is equal to <m>N</m>.

                <p>
                  Ignoring the rules for scaling by <m>R</m>, we know each of the first four results holds for abelian groups (and the maps are the same). 
                  So, we merely need to prove that the rules for scaling are respected in each case. 
                  In more detail:

                        From the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ump-quotient"/>, we already know that <m>\ov{f}</m> is a well-defined homomorphism of groups under <m>+</m> and that it is the unique one such that <m>\ov{f} \circ \pi = f</m>. 
                        It remains only to show <m>\ov{f}</m> preserves scaling: 
                        <me>\ov{f}(r (m +N)) = \ov{f} (rm + N) = f(rm) = r f(m) = r \ov{f}(m + N).</me> 
                        where the third equation uses that <m>f</m> preserves scaling.

                        given by <m>\ov{\varphi}(m + \ker(\varphi)) = \varphi(m)</m>, and it remains only to show this map preserves scaling.

                        For the third, we already know (from 817) that <m>B/A</m> is a subgroup of <m>M/A</m> under <m>+</m>. 
                        Given <m>r \in R</m> and <m>b +A \in B/A</m> we have <m>r(b+A) = rb + A</m> which belongs to <m>B/A</m> since <m>rb \in B</m>. 
                        This proves <m>B/A</m> is a submodule of <m>M/A</m>. 
                        Also from 817 we know there is an isomorphism of abelian groups <m>\varphi: (M/A)/(B/A) \to M/B</m> given by <m>\varphi((m+A) + B/A) = m + B</m> and it remains only to show it is <m>R</m>-linear:

                      <p>
                        The Lattice Theorem is the most complicaed to gerenlize. 
                        From 817 we know thre is a bijection between the set of subgroups of <m>M</m> and that contain <m>N</m> and subgroups of the quotient group <m>M/N</m>, and the maps are the same as given in the statment. 
                        We just need to prove that these maps send submodules to submodules. 
                        If <m>K</m> is a submodule of <m>M</m> containing <m>N</m>, then by part (3) we know <m>K/N</m> is a submodule of <m>M/N</m>.
                      </p>
          
                      <p>
                        If <m>T</m> is a submodule of <m>M/N</m>, then <m>\pi^{-1}(T)</m> is an abelian group. 
                        For <m>r \in R</m> adn <m>m \in \pi^{-1}(T)</m> we have <m>\pi(m) \in T</m> and hence <m>\pi(rm) = r\pi(m) \in T</m> too, since <m>T</m> is a submodule. 
                        This proves <m>\pi^{-1}(T)</m> is a submodule.

              <p>
                In <xref ref="ch-presentations"/>, we learned about free groups and presentations, ways of representing groups in more digestible ways.
                Recall that a <xref text="title" ref="def-free-group"/> is essentially a way of creating a generic group from a specific set. 
                These sets were the <em>generators</em> of the free group, which was called <em>free</em> due to the lack of relations, or combinations of elements that canceled out to the identity.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the realm of modules, there are many similarites, such as the notion of a <em>free module</em>. 
                Free modules are, essentially, ways of creating generic modules from specific sets.
                These sets are called the <em>generators</em> of the free module,
                <fn>Though, in the world of linear algebra and vector spaces, such sets are referred to as <em>spanning sets</em>.</fn>
                which is called <em>free</em> due to the lack of relations, or <em>linear</em> combinations of elements that cancel out to zero.
              </p>

              <p>
                Every group has a <xref text="title" ref="def-presentation"/>, a set of generators and relations that express the structure of the group.
                This presentation can be obtained by starting with a free group and taking quotients corresponding to the relations between the generators.
                Thus, every group can be expressed as the quotient of a free group.
              </p>

              <p>
                Similarly, we shall see that every module can be expressed as the quotient of a free module.
                Additionally, the concept of a presentation for a module exists as well, which we will explore in greater depth in <xref ref="ch-modgen"/>.

                Let <m>R</m> be a ring. 
                The standard free <m>R</m>-module CITEX of rank <m>n</m>, <m>R^n</m>, is finitely generated, since it is generated by <m>e_1, \dots, e_n</m> where <m>e_i := \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}</m>, with a <m>1</m> in the <m>i</m>-th position. 
                This holds since given any element <m>v = \begin{bmatrix} r_1 \\ \vdots \\ r_n\end{bmatrix}</m> of <m>R^n</m> we have <m>v = \sum_i r_i e_i</m>.

              <p>
                A one element subset <m>\{m\}</m> of an <m>R</m>-module <m>M</m> is linearly independent if and only if whenever <m>rm =0</m>, we have <m>r = 0</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                But it is possible for one elements subsets to be linearly dependent: For example, let <m>R</m> be any ring and <m>I</m> and (two-sided) ideal such that <m>I \ne 0</m>. 
                Then I claim that every non-empty subset of <m>M = R/I</m> is linearly dependent. 
                For say <m>A</m> is a such a nonempty subset. 
                For any <m>a \in A</m>, pick any <m>r \in I</m> such that <m>r \ne 0</m>. 
                Then <m>ra = 0</m> (since <m>a = y + I</m> for some <m>y \in R</m> and hence <m>ra = ry + I = I = 0_M</m>) and this shows <m>A</m> is linearly dependent. 
                In particular, even a one-element subset of <m>M</m> is linearly dependent.

                        Let <m>A</m> be the set of all linearly independent subsets of <m>M</m> that contain <m>T</m>. 
                        We can order <m>A</m> with respect to inclusion. 
                        Let <m>X</m> be a totally ordered subset of <m>A</m>, and let <m>U</m> be the union of all elements in <m>X</m>. 
                        Let <m>\{u_i\}</m> be a set of elements in <m>U</m> such that <m>\sum_{i=0}^nr_iu_i=0</m> for some <m>r_i\in R</m>, where <m>i\leq n</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>. 
                        As <m>U</m> is the union of all elements in <m>X</m>, there exists some <m>B_1</m> such that <m>u_1\in B_1</m>. 
                        However, as <m>X</m> is totally ordered, there exists some <m>B_2</m> such that <m>B_2</m> contains <m>B_1</m> and <m>u_2\in B_2</m>. 
                        Continuing in this way, we see that there exists some <m>B_n\in X</m> such that <m>\{u_i\}\subseteq B_n</m>. 
                        As <m>B_n</m> is linearly independent, we know that <m>\sum_{i=0}^nr_iu_i=0</m> means that <m>r_i=0</m> for all <m>i</m>. 
                        Thus <m>U</m> is indeed linearly independent, making it an upper bound for <m>X</m>.

                        However, as <m>x\neq 0</m> and <m>x\not\in N</m>, this means that <m>x\not\in T</m>.

                A key difference between free modules over rings that are not fields and vector spaces is that not every linearly independent subset of a free module can be extended to a basis. 
                For example, <m>\{3\}</m> is a linearly independent subset of <m>\Z</m>, but it cannot be extended to a basis. 
                Indeed, any set of the form <m>\{3, n \}</m> with <m>n \ne 3</m> is linearly dependent since <m>n \cdot 3 + (-3) \cdot n = 0</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Likewise, over arbitrary rings, not every subset that generates a free module necessarily contains a basis. 
                For instance, <m>\{3,5\}</m> generated <m>\Z</m> as a module over itself, but no subset of it is a basis.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                (Note that <m>\Z</m> has precisely two bases as a module over itself: <m>\{1\}</m> and <m>\{-1\}</m>. )

                  As <m>A</m> is a basis of <m>M</m> it generates <m>M</m> as an <m>R</m>-module, and thus there exists <m>r_1,\dots,\r_n\in R</m> and <m>a_1,\dots,a_n\in A</m> such that <m>m=r_1a_1+\dots+r_na_n</m>.

                <p>
                  We need to prove <m>f</m> is an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism. 
                  I'll just show it preserves scaling â the proof for addition is similar. 
                  Given <m>x \in R</m> and <m>m \in M</m>, we have <m>m = \sum_{b \in B} r_b b</m> for some <m>r_b \in R</m>, and hence <m>xm = \sum_b (xr_b) b</m>. 
                  By definition of <m>f</m>, 
                  <me>
                    \varphi(xm) = \sum_b (xr_b) j(b) = x \sum_b r_b j(b) = x \varphi(m).

                <p>
                  Finally, for any <m>y \in B</m> we have <m>y = \sum_{b \in B} r_b b</m> where <m>r_b = 1</m> if <m>b = y</m> and <m>r_b = 0</m> if <m>b \ne y</m>. 
                  So <m>f(y) = j(y)</m> by construction. 
                  This proves existence.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Every <m>R</m>-module is the quotient of a free module.
                  Thus for every <m>R</m>-module <m>M</m> there exists a free module <m>F</m> that surjects onto <m>M</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Given a module <m>M</m>, first take a generating set for <m>M</m>, say <m>\Gamma=\left\{m_{i}\right\}_{i \in \Lambda}</m>.
                  Notice that a generating set always exists: for example, we can take <m>\Gamma=M</m>, though of course that is a bit of an overkill, since it's quite likely that some elements can be obtained from linear combinations of others. 
                  Next, we construct a free module on the set <m>\Lambda</m>; more precisely, we take a free module on as many generators as generators for <m>M</m> that we picked. 
                  Now the map
                  <me>
                    \begin{aligned}
                    &amp; \bigoplus_{i \in \Lambda} R \stackrel{\pi}{\longrightarrow} M \\
                    &amp; \left(r_{i}\right) \longmapsto \sum_{i \in \Lambda} r_{i} m_{i} .
                    \end{aligned}
                  </me>
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  Notice this map actually makes sense: the tuples <m>\left(r_{i}\right)</m> have only finitely many nonzero entries, and thus <m>\sum_{i \in \Lambda} r_{i} m_{i}</m> is a (finite) linear combination of our chosen generators. 
                  Moreover, since we chose the <m>m_{i}</m> to be generators for <m>M</m>, this map <m>\pi</m> is surjective. 
                  It is also easy to check that it is an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism: in fact, this is the <m>R</m>-module homomorphism we would get from the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ump-for-free-modules"/> by setting <m>e_{i} \mapsto m_{i}</m>.

                  Since the identity map <m>\id_N</m> is also an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism such that <m>id_N(b)=b</m> for every <m>b\in B</m>, by the uniqueness clause in the <xref text='title' ref="thm-ump-for-free-modules"/>, we have <m>\phi\circ \varphi=\id_n</m>.

                  Given an isomorphism <m>f: R^n \xra{\cong} R^m</m> of <m>R</m>-modules, by Lemma <xref provisional="cite"/> we have an induced homomorphism of <m>R/I</m>-module <m>\ov{f}: R^n/IR^n \to R^m /IR^m</m>. 
                  Likewise, the inverse map <m>f^{-1}: R^m \xra{\cong} R^n</m> induces a map <m>\ov{f^{-1}}: R^m/IR^m \to R^n /IR^n</m>. 
                  Also by that Lemma <xref provisional="cite"/> we have <m>\ov{f} \circ \ov{f^{-1}} = \ov{f \circ f^{-1}} = \ov{\id} = \id</m> and similarly <m>\ov{f^{-1}} \circ \ov{f}</m> is the identity. 
                  That is, we have an isomorphism <m>R^n/IR^n \cong R^m /IR^m</m> of <m>R/I</m>-modules.

                  Next, I claim that there is an isomorphism

                    R^n/IR^n \cong (R/I)^n
                  </me> 
                  of <m>R/I</m>-modules. 
                  Define <m>R^n \to (R/I)^n</m> in the evident way (modding out by <m>I</m> entry-wise). 
                  It is a surjective map of <m>R</m>-modules with kernel <m>I R^n</m> and thus, by the <xref text = "title" ref="fit-module"/>, it induces an isomorphism
                  <me>
                    g: R^n/I R^n \xra{\cong} (R/I)^n
                  </me> 
                  given by <m>g((r_1, \dots, r_n)^\tau + IR^n) = (r_1 + I, \dots, r_n + I)^\tau</m> (where <m>\tau</m> denotes taking the transpose). 
                  Now, what we have said so far only shows that <m>g</m> is isomorphism of <m>R</m>-modules, but it is easy to see that <m>g</m> is in fact <m>R/I</m>-linear (I'll leave that to you) and thus it is an isomorphism of <m>R/I</m>-modules.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Putting the results proven so far together, we conclude that <m>(R/I)^n</m> and <m>(R/I)^m</m> are isomorphic as <m>R/I</m>-modules. 
                  Since <m>R/I</m> is a field and since we are assuming the result holds for fields, we deduce that <m>n = m</m>.

                Checking the definition carefully, we see that both the empty set and the set <m>\{0\}</m> form bases for the zero module over the <m>0</m> ring. 
                This gives an example of a module with two bases of different cardinalities, justifying why the suppostion that <m>1\ne 0</m> was used in <xref ref="thm-uniqueness-of-rank-over-commutative-rings"/>.

                <p>
                  Let <m>w_1, \dots, w_n</m> be a list of distinct elements of <m>I \cup \{v\}</m> and suppose 
                  <me>c_1w_1+\cdots+c_nw_n=0</me>
                  for some <m>c_i \in F</m>. 
                  If <m>v \ne w_i</m> for all <m>i</m>, then <m>c_i = 0</m> for all <m>i</m>, since <m>I</m> is linearly independent. 
                  Thus <m>v=w_i</m> for some <m>i\leq n</m>.
                  Without loss of generality, say <m>w_1 = v</m>.
                  If <m>c_1 \ne 0</m>, then we may write
                  <md>
                    <mrow> 0 &amp;= c_1w_1+\cdots+c_nw_n </mrow>

                  placing <m>v\in\Span(I)</m>, contrary to the assumption. 
                  So we must have <m>c_1 = 0</m>, yielding 
                  <me>c_2w_2+\cdots+c_nw_n=0.</me>
                  But then <m>v \ne w_i</m> for all <m>i</m>, and thus we have <m>c_i = 0</m> for all <m>i \geq 2</m> by the same reasoning as in the first case (since <m>I</m> is linearly independent).
                  Thus <m>A \cup \{m\}</m> is linearly independent.

                  Then there is a subset <m>B</m> such that <m>I \subseteq B \subseteq S</m> and <m>B</m> is a basis of <m>V.</m>
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>\cP</m> denote the collection of all subsets <m>X</m> of <m>V</m> such that <m>I\subseteq X \subseteq S</m> and <m>X</m> is linearly independent. 
                  We make <m>\cP</m> into a poset by the order relation <m>\subseteq</m>, set containment.
                  Note that <m>I \in \cP</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Let <m>\cT</m> be any totally ordered subset of <m>\cP</m>. 
                  If <m>\cT</m> is empty, then <m>\cT</m> is (vacuously) bounded above by <m>I</m>.
                  Assume <m>\cT</m> is non-empty. 
                  Let <m>Z = \bigcup_{Y \in \cT} Y</m>. 
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Given <m>z_1, \dots, z_m \in Z</m>, for each <m>i</m> we have <m>z_i \in Y_i</m> for some <m>Y_{i} \in \cT</m>. 
                  Since <m>\cT</m> is totally ordered, one of <m>Y_1, \dots, Y_m</m> contains all the others and hence it contains all the <m>z_i</m>'s. 
                  Since each <m>Y_i</m> is linearly independent, this shows <m>z_1, \dots, z_m</m> are linearly independent. 
                  We have shown that every finite subset of <m>Z</m> is linearly independent, and hence <m>Z</m> is linearly independent. 
                  Since <m>\cT</m> is non-empty, <m>Z \supseteq I</m>. 
                  Since each member of <m>\cT</m> is contained in <m>S</m>, <m>Z \subseteq S</m>. 
                  Thus, <m>Z \in \cP</m>, and it is an upper bound for <m>\cT</m>.
                  We may thus apply <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/> to conclude that <m>\cP</m> has at least one maximal element, <m>B</m>. 
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Note that <m>B</m> is linearly independent and <m>I \subseteq B \subseteq S</m> by construction. 
                  Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>B</m> does not span <m>V</m>.
                  Since <m>S</m> spans <m>V</m>, if <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then <m>\Span(B)</m> would have to be all of <m>V</m>. 
                  <fn>For note that if <m>\Span(S) = V</m> and <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then for any <m>v \in V</m> we may write <m>v = \sum_i c_i s_i</m> for <m>s_i \in S</m> and <m>s_i = \sum_j a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m> with <m>b_{i,j} \in B</m> and hence <m>v= \sum_{i,j} c_i a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m>, which implies <m>\Span(B) = V</m>.</fn>
                  Since we are assuming <m>\Span(B) \ne V</m>, there must be at least one <m>v \in S</m> such that <m>v \notin \Span(B)</m>. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  Consider <m>B \cup \{v\}</m>. 
                  Then <m>I \subset B \cup \{v\} \subseteq S</m> and, by <xref ref="lem-linear-independence-and-span"/>, <m>B \cup \{v\}</m> is linearly independent. 
                  This shows that <m>B \cup \{v\}</m> is an element of <m>\cP</m> that is strictly bigger than <m>B</m>, contrary to the maximality of <m>B</m>. 
                  So, <m>B</m> must span <m>V</m> and hence it is a basis.

                <p>
                  Suppose that for some <m>0 \leq k &lt; m</m>, we have found <m>v_1, \dots, v_k \in B</m> such that <m>B'' := (B \setminus \{v_1, \dots, v_k\}) \cup \{w_1, \dots, w_k\}</m> is a basis for some <m>k &lt; m</m>.

                Consider <m>V = \R^\N=\R\times \R\times \R \times \dots</m>, and define rules for addition and scaling degree-wise in the evident way.

              <p>
                It is not hard to see <m>V</m> is a <m>\R</m>-vector space. 
                It can be identified with the collection of all sequences <m>\{a_n\}</m> of real numbers. 
                One might be interested in a basis for this vector space. 
                At first glance the most obvious choice would be <m>E=\{e_1,e_2,\ldots\}</m>, where <m>e_i</m> is the sequence with a <m>1</m> in the <m>i</m>-th position and <m>0</m>'s everywhere else.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                However, this set does not span <m>V</m> as <m>v = (1,1,\ldots)</m> can not be represented as a finite linear combination of these elements. 
                (It turns out that <m>E</m> is the basis for the direct sum <m>\bigoplus_{i\in \N}\R</m>, which may be identified with all sequences having only a finite number of non-zero terms.)
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Now, since we know since <m>v</m> is not in <m>\Span(E)</m>, we have that <m>E \cup \{v\}</m> is a linearly independent set.
                However, this does not span either as <m>(1, 2, 3, 4, \dots)</m> is not in the span of this set. 
                We know that <m>V</m> has a basis, but it can be shown that no countable collection of vectors forms a basis for this space, in fact <m>\dim_\R \R^\N =|\R|</m>.

                        Let <m>V</m> be a finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector space. 
                        Then <m>F</m> has a finite spanning set <m>S</m> and by <xref ref="thm-finding-intermediate-bases"/> there is a basis <m>B \subseteq S</m> for <m>V</m>. 
                        Notice that <m>B</m> is necessarily finite and <m>V=F B</m>. 
                        Set <m>|B|=n</m> and <m>B=\left\{b_{1}, \ldots, b_{n}\right\}</m>. 
                        By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ump-for-free-modules"/>, there is a linear transformation <m>f: F^{n} \rightarrow V</m> such that <m>f\left(e_{i}\right)=b_{i}</m> as well as a linear transformation <m>g: V \rightarrow F^{n}</m> such that <m>g\left(b_{i}\right)=e_{i}</m>. 
                        Then both <m>f \circ g: V \rightarrow V</m> and <m>g \circ f: F^{n} \rightarrow F^{n}</m> are linear transformation which agree with the identity map on a basis. 
                        Hence by the uniqueness part of <xref text="title" ref="thm-ump-for-free-modules"/> we have <m>f \circ g=\mathrm{id}_{V}</m> and <m>g \circ f=\mathrm{id}_{F^{n}}</m>.

                        We claim that <m>\varphi(B)</m> is a basis for <m>F^{n}</m>.

                        since <m>\varphi</m> is injective.

                        If <m>v \in F^{n}</m>, then since <m>B</m> spans <m>F^{m}</m> we have

                        which shows <m>\varphi(B)</m> spans <m>F^{n}</m>.

                  Pick a basis <m>X</m> of <m>W</m>. 
                  Regarded as a subset of <m>V</m>, <m>X</m> remains linearly independent and thus it may be extended to a basis of <m>V</m> by Corollary . 
                  Let us write this basis of <m>V</m> as <m>X \cup Y</m> with <m>X \cap Y = \emptyset</m>.

                <p>
                  Given <m>v + W</m> we have <m>v = \sum_i a_i x_i + \sum_j b_j y_j</m> for some <m>x_i \in X, y_j \in Y</m> and scalars <m>a_i, b_j</m>. 
                  Since <m>x + V = 0</m> for all <m>x \in X</m>, we have <m>v + W = \sum_j b_j z_j</m>. 
                  This proves <m>Z</m> spans. 
                  Say <m>\sum_j c_j y_j + W = 0</m> for some <m>y_1, \dots, y_m \in Y</m>. 
                  Then <m>\sum_j c_j y_j \in W</m> and hence <m>\sum_j c_j y_j = \sum_i a_i x_i</m>, whence <m>\sum_j c_j y_j + \sum_i - a_i x_i = 0</m>. 
                  Since <m>X \cup Y</m> is linearly independent, <m>c_j = 0</m> and <m>a_i = 0</m> for all <m>j, i</m>. 
                  This proves <m>Z</m> is linearly independent.

                  Let <m>I</m> be a maximal ideal in <m>R</m>. 
                  Thus <m>R/I</m> is a field. 
                  Lemma 1.58 tells us that <m>M/IM</m> and <m>N/IN</m> are <m>R/I</m>-vector spaces. 
                  Additionally, this gives rise to <m>\overline{p}:M/IM\to N/IN</m>, which is a surjective <m>R/I</m>-module linear transformation.

                The notion that a homomorphism between finitely generated free modules can be represented as a matrix is extremely important!
                It allows us to translate information we know about matrices into information we know about homomorophisms and linear transformations, and vice versa.

            <p>
              The notion of similar matrices aligns with the idea of moving between bases. 
              Translate your data into the language using your new basis (using <m>P</m>), perform the desired transformations (using <m>A</m>), and then translate this new data back into the original basis (using <m>P\inv</m>)
            </p>

            <remark>
              <p>
                For elements <m>A, B \in \mathrm{GL}_{n}(R)</m>, the notions of similar and conjugate are the same.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Let <m>V, W</m> be finitely generated free modules over a commutative ring <m>R</m>, let <m>B</m> and <m>B^{\prime}</m> be bases of <m>V</m>, let <m>C</m> and <m>C^{\prime}</m> be bases of <m>W</m>, and let <m>f: V \rightarrow W</m> be a homomorphism. 
                  Then
                  <me>
                    [f]_{B^{\prime}}^{C^{\prime}}=\left[\mathrm{id}_{W}\right]_{C}^{C^{\prime}}[f]_{B}^{C}\left[\mathrm{id}_{V}\right]_{B^{\prime}}^{B}
                  </me>
                  In particular, if <m>g: V \rightarrow V</m> is an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism, then <m>[g]_{B}^{B}</m> and <m>[g]_{B^{\prime}}^{B^{\prime}}</m> are similar.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Since <m>f=\mathrm{id}_{W} \circ f \circ \mathrm{id}_{V}</m>, by <xref ref="lem-cob-and-identity"/> we have
                  <me>
                    [f]_{B^{\prime}}^{C^{\prime}}=\left[\mathrm{id}_{W}\right]_{C}^{C^{\prime}}[f]_{B}^{C}\left[\mathrm{id}_{V}\right]_{B^{\prime}}^{B}
                  </me>
                  Setting <m>V=W, B=C, B^{\prime}=C^{\prime}</m>, and <m>f=\mathrm{id}_{V}</m> we have <m>\left[\mathrm{id}_{V}\right]_{B^{\prime}}^{B^{\prime}}=\left[\mathrm{id}_{V}\right]_{B}^{B^{\prime}}\left[\operatorname{id}_{V}\right]_{B}^{B}\left[\operatorname{id}_{V}\right]_{B^{\prime}}^{B}</m>. 
                  Notice that <m>\left[\operatorname{id}_{V}\right]_{B}^{B}=\left[\operatorname{id}_{V}\right]_{B^{\prime}}^{B^{\prime}}=I</m> is the identity matrix, so the previous formula says that
                  <me>
                    I=\left[\mathrm{id}_{V}\right]_{B}^{B^{\prime}} I\left[\mathrm{id}_{V}\right]_{B^{\prime}}^{B}
                  </me>
                  Setting <m>P=\left[\mathrm{id}_{V}\right]_{B}^{B^{\prime}}</m>, we notice that the previous identity gives <m>P^{-1}=\left[\mathrm{id}_{V}\right]_{B^{\prime}}^{B}</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Now set <m>V=W, B=C, B^{\prime}=C^{\prime}</m> and <m>f=g</m> to obtain
                  <me>
                    [g]_{B^{\prime}}^{B^{\prime}}=\left[\mathrm{id}_{V}\right]_{B}^{B^{\prime}}[g]_{B}^{B}\left[\mathrm{id}_{V}\right]_{B^{\prime}}^{B}=P[g]_{B}^{B} P^{-1}.

            <p>
              When working with groups, we had the notion of the presentation of a group.
              We proved that every group was the quotient of a free group, where the presentation of the group was obtained by taking quotients corresponding to the relations of the presentation.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the realm of modules, we have shown that <xref text="title" ref="thm-free-quotient"/>.
              We also know that every free module of rank <m>n</m> is isomorphic to <m>R^n</m>.
              Thus, we can obtain a <em>presentation</em> for a module by taking quotients of <m>R^n</m> corresponding to our relations, which are given in the form of a matrix (or equivalently by a homomorphism between a pair of free modules.)

              Conversely, we might be given a matrix and ask about what module it represents; 
              one thing to keep in mind is that some presentations might be inefficient, either by having more generators or more relations than necessary. 
              We want to answer to key questions: given a presentation for a module, how to find a more efficient presentation; and how to decide if two different presentations actually give us isomorphic modules. 
              Keeping these goals in mind, let's try a more elaborate example.

                  Since <m>\mathbb{Z}^{4}</m> is generated by its standard basis elements <m>\left\{e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}, e_{4}\right\}</m>, we deduce as in <xref ref="lem-fg-quotient-mod"/> that <m>M=\mathbb{Z}^{4} / \operatorname{im}\left(t_{A}\right)</m> is generated by the cosets of the <m>e_{i}</m>.

                    N=R\left\{\left[\begin{array}{l}
                    2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 0
                    \end{array}\right],\left[\begin{array}{c}
                    1 \\ 9 \\ -2 \\ 1
                    \end{array}\right],\left[\begin{array}{l}
                    0 \\ 5 \\ 7 \\ 2
                    \end{array}\right]\right\}=R\left\{2 e_{1}+3 e_{2}+e_{3}, e_{1}+9 e_{2}-2 e_{3}+e_{4}, 5 e_{2}+7 e_{3}+2 e_{4}\right\}
                  </me>
                  Since <m>N</m> maps to 0 under the quotient map <m>q: \mathbb{Z}^{4} \rightarrow M=\mathbb{Z}^{4} / N</m>, the relations of <m>M</m> can be written as
                  <me>\begin{cases}2 m_{1}+3 m_{2}+m_{3} &amp; =0 \\ m_{1}+9 m_{2}-2 m_{3}+m_{4} &amp; =0 \\ 5 m_{2}+7 m_{3}+2 m_{4} &amp; =0\end{cases}</me>
                  We can now see that this is a rather inefficient presentation, since we can clearly use the first equation to solve for for <m>m_{3}=-2 m_{1}-3 m_{2}</m>. 
                  This implies that <m>M</m> can be generated using only <m>m_{1}, m_{2}</m> and <m>m_{4}</m>, that is
                  <me>M=R\left\{m_{1}, m_{2}, m_{3}, m_{4}\right\}=R\left\{m_{1}, m_{2}, m_{4}\right\}.</me>
                  This eliminates the first equation and the latter two become
                  <me>\begin{cases}5 m_{1}+15 m_{2}+m_{4} &amp; =0 \\ -14 m_{2}-16 m_{2}+2 m_{4} &amp; =0\end{cases}</me>
                  Now we can also eliminate <m>m_{4}</m>, i.e leaving just two generators <m>m_{1}, m_{2}</m> that satisfy
                  <me>-24 m_{1}-46 m_{2}=0.</me>
                </p>
  
                <p>
                  Another way to do this is to look at the matrix <m>A</m> and use elementary row operations to "make zeros" on the 1st and 2nd columns, as follows:
                  <me>
                    A=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
                    2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 5 \\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 7 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
                    \end{array}\right] \rightarrow\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
                    0 &amp; 5 &amp; -14 \\ 0 &amp; 15 &amp; -16 \\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 7 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
                    \end{array}\right] \rightarrow\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
                    0 &amp; 0 &amp; -24 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -46 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 13 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
                    \end{array}\right]
                  </me>
                </p>
  
                <p>
                  Eliminating the generators <m>m_{3}</m> and <m>m_{4}</m> amounts to dropping the first two columns (which are the 3rd and 4th standard basis vectors) as well as the last two rows. 
                  As we will prove soon, this shows that the <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>-module presented by <m>A</m> is isomorphic to the <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>-module presented by
                </p>
  
                <p>
                  <me>
                    B=\left[\begin{array}{l} -24 \\ -46 \end{array}\right]
                  </me>
                </p>
  
                <p>
                  We can go further. 
                  Set <m>m_{1}^{\prime}:=m_{1}+2 m_{2}</m>. 
                  Then <m>m_{1}^{\prime}</m> and <m>m_{2}</m> also form a generating set of <m>M</m>.
                  The relation on <m>m_{1}, m_{2}</m> translates to

                <p>

                <p>
                  Note that we have done a row operation (subtract twice row 1 from row 2 ) to get from <m>B</m> to <m>C</m>. 
                  Continuing in this fashion by subtracting 12 row 2 from row 1 we also form

                  The last matrix <m>D</m> presents the module <m>M^{\prime}=\mathbb{Z}^{2} / \operatorname{im}\left(t_{D}\right)</m> with generators <m>a, b</m>, where

                <p>
                  and relation <m>2 a=0</m>. 
                  This module <m>M^{\prime}</m> is isomorphic to our original module <m>M</m>. 
                  As we will see, this proves <m>M \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} / 2</m>. 
                  An explicit isomorphism between <m>M^{\prime}</m> and <m>\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} / 2</m> is given by sending <m>\mathbb{Z}^{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} / 2</m> by the unique <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>-module homomorphism defined by

                </p>
  
                <p>
                  Now notice that the kernel of this homomorphism is the submodule <m>\left(2 e_{2}\right) \mathbb{Z}=\operatorname{im}\left(t_{D}\right)</m>. 
                  Then the first isomorphism theorem gives <m>M^{\prime}=\mathbb{Z}^{2} / \operatorname{im}\left(t_{D}\right) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} / 2</m>.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Note: This proof was not covered in class. 
                  Assume <m>B</m> is obtained from <m>A</m> by a single one of the steps listed above. 
                  We need to prove that there is an isomorphism <m>R^m/\im(T_A) \cong R^{m'}/\im(T_B)</m> of <m>R</m>-modules. 
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        In this case, <m>B = E A</m> for some elementary matrix <m>E</m>. 
                        More generally, let <m>E</m> be any invertible matrix such that <m>B = EA</m>. 
                        Then <m>T_E: R^m \to R^m</m> is an isomorphism and it maps <m>\im(T_A)</m> bijectively onto <m>\im(T_B)</m>. 
                        It follows that the kernel of the composition <m>R^m \xra{T_E} R^m \onto R^m/\im(T_B)</m> is <m>\im(T_A)</m> and hence by the first isomorphism theorem it induces an isomorphism 
                        <me>
                          R^m/\im(T_A) \xra{\cong} R^m/\im(T_B).
                        </me> 
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        In this case, <m>B=AE</m> for some elementary matrix <m>E</m>. 
                        More generally, assume <m>E</m> is any invertible matrix such that <m>B = AE</m>. 
                        Since <m>T_E</m> is an isomorphism, we have 
                        <me>
                          \im(T_B) = \im(T_{AE})=\im(T_A\circ T_E)=\im(T_A)
                        </me>
                        and so <m>R^m/\im(T_A) = R^{m}/\im(T_B)</m>. 
                        (For this one we get equality, not merely an isomorphism.) 
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        For notational simplicity, let us assume <m>i = j =1</m>; 
                        that is, the first column of <m>A</m> is <m>e_1</m> and <m>B</m> is obtained by deleting the first row and column of <m>A</m>, giving a <m>(m-1) \times (n-1)</m> matrix. 
                        So 
                        <me>
                          A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; r \\ 0 &amp; B \\\end{bmatrix}
                        </me>
                        where <m>r</m> denotes some row vector and <m>0</m> denotes a column of all <m>0</m>'s. 
                        Let <m>p: R^{m} \onto R^{m-1}</m> and <m>q: R^{n} \onto R^{n-1}</m> be projection onto the last <m>m-1</m> and <m>n-1</m> components, respectively. 
                        Because of the nature of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, the diagram (page 40 in notes) commutes. 
                        Moreover, the kernel of <m>q</m> is <m>Re_1</m> and the kernel of <m>p</m> is <m>Re_1</m>, and since the first column of <m>A</m> is <m>e_1</m>, <m>T_A</m> maps the kernel of <m>q</m> bijectively onto the kernel of <m>p</m>. 
                        A âdiagram chase'' shows that <m>\coker(T_A) \cong \coker(T_B)</m>. 
                        In detail: Since the diagram commutes, <m>p(\im(T_A)) \subseteq \im(T_B)</m> and hence <m>p</m> induces an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism 
                        <me>
                          \ov{p}: R^m/\im(T_A)   \to R^{m-1}/\im(T_B).
                        </me>
                        (by the <m>0</m>-th isomorphism theorem). 
                        Since <m>p</m> is onto, so is <m>\ov{p}</m>. 
                        Suppose <m>v + \im(T_A) \in \ker(\ov{p})</m>. 
                        So, <m>p(v) \in \im(T_B)</m>. Say <m>p(v) = B w</m>. 
                        Since <m>q</m> is onto, <m>w = q(u)</m> for some <m>u</m>. 
                        Then 
                        <me>
                          p(v - Au) = p(v) - pA(u) = p(v) - Bq(u) = p(v) - Bw = p(v) - p(v) = 0, 
                        </me> 
                        and thus <m>v - Au \in \ker(p)</m>. 
                        As noted above, <m>T_A</m> maps <m>\ker(q)</m> onto <m>\ker(p)</m> and hence 
                        <me>
                          v - Au = Ay
                        </me>
                        for some vector <m>y</m>. 
                        This proves <m>v = A(u+y) \in \im(T_A)</m> and hence that <m>v +\im(T_A) = 0</m> in <m>R^m/\im(T_A)</m>. 
                        This proves <m>\ov{p}</m> is one-to-one.

                  (I.e., <m>g</m> is the unique <m>R</m>-map sending the <m>i</m>-th standard basis vector <m>e_i</m> to <m>(0, \dots, 0, \ov{1}, 0, \dots, 0)</m> with <m>\ov{1}</m> in the <m>i</m>-th position, for <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>, and to <m>e_i</m> itself for <m>i &gt; n</m>.)

              <p>
                We now address the question of which modules have finite presentations. 
                Any such module must be finitely generated (since the cosets of <m>e_1, \dots, e_m</m> generate <m>R^m/\im(T_A)</m> for any <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>). 
                If <m>M</m> is finitely generated, say by <m>m</m> elements, then we can find a surjective <m>R</m>-module homomorphism
                <me>
                  \pi: R^m \onto M.
                </me> 
                Provided the kernel of <m>\pi</m> is also finitely generated, say by <m>n</m> elements, then we may find a surjection 
                <me>
                  g: R^n \onto \ker(\pi).
                </me> 
                The composition <m>R^n \xra{g} \ker(\pi) \subseteq R^m</m> is a map between free <m>R</m>-modules and is thus equal to <m>T_A</m> for some <m>n \times m</m> matrix <m>A</m>. 
                Then <m>\im(T_A) = \ker(\pi)</m> and hence by the <xref ref="thm-fit-module" text="title"/>
                <me>
                  R^m/\im(A) = R^m/\ker(\pi) \cong M,

              <p>
                So the real question is: For a given ring <m>R</m>, is it the case that for all <m>m</m>, every submodule of <m>R^m</m> is finitely generated? 
                The answer is "no" in general, but it does hold for many rings of interest:

                      <p>
                        Every ideal of <m>R</m> is finitely generated â i.e., for every ideal <m>I</m>, there exists a finite set of elements <m>x_1, \dots, x_n</m> in <m>I</m> such that <m>I = R \cdot x_1 + \cdots + R \cdot x_n</m>. 
                        In this case we say <m>R</m> is <em>noetherian</em>.

                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Assume every ideal is finitely generated and that such a chain is given. 
                  Let <m>J = \cup_n I_n</m>. 
                  For <m>a \in J, r \in R</m> we have <m>a \in I_n</m> for some <m>n</m> and hence <m>ra \in I_n \subseteq J</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  If <m>a,b \in J</m>, then <m>a \in I_n</m> and <m>b \in I_m</m> for some <m>n,m</m> and hence there is a <m>N</m> such that <m>a,b \in I_N</m>. 
                  It follows that <m>a \pm b \in I_N \subseteq J</m>. 
                  Finally <m>0 \in J</m>. 
                  Thus <m>J</m> is an ideal.
                  Thus by assumption <m>J</m> is finitely generated, say <m>J = Rx_1 + \cdots + Rx_m</m> for some <m>x_1, \dots, x_m \in J</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Each <m>x_i</m> belongs to one of the <m>I_n</m>'s and hence, since there are only a finite number of such elements and ideas are nested, there is an <m>N</m> such that <m>x_1, \dots, x_m \in I_N</m>. 
                  It follows that <m>I_N = J</m> and hence <m>I_N = I_{N+1} = I_{N+2} = \cdots</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Assume <m>R</m> has the acc for ideals and let <m>J</m> be any ideal. 
                  Pick any element <m>a_1\in I</m> and set <m>I_1 = Ra_1</m>. 
                  If <m>J = I_1</m> we are done. 
                  If not, pick <m>a_2 \in I \setminus I_1</m> and set <m>I_2 = Ra_1 + Ra_2</m>. 
                  If <m>J = I_2</m> we are done and if not pick <m>a_3 \in I\setminus I_2</m> and let <m>I_3 = Ra_1 + Ra_2 + Ra_3</m>. 
                  In this way we form a strictly ascending chain <m>I_1 \subset I_2 \subset I_3 \subset</m>, and this process cannot be continued forever since <m>R</m> has the acc. 
                  When it terminates, we have <m>J = Ra_1 + Ra_2 + \cdots + Ra_N</m> for some <m>a_1, \dots, a_N</m> and thus <m>J</m> is finitely generated.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  I will just prove the following special case (since it is all we need): For each <m>n \geq 1</m>, every submodule of <m>R^n</m> is finitely generated. The base case <m>n=1</m> holds by definition (and Lemma ), since a submodule of <m>R^1</m> is the same thing as an ideal.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Assume <m>n &gt; 1</m> and the result holds for <m>R^{n-1}</m>. Let <m>M</m> be any submodule of <m>R^n</m>. 
                  Define 
                  <me> 
                    \pi: R^n \onto R^1
                  </me> 
                  to be the projection onto the last component of <m>R^n</m>. 
                  The kernel of <m>\pi_n</m> may be identified with <m>R^{n-1}</m> and so <m>N := \ker(\pi) \cap M</m> is a submodule of <m>R^{n-1}</m>, and it is therefore finitely generated by assumption. 
                  The image <m>\pi(M)</m> of <m>M</m> under <m>\pi</m> is a submodule of <m>R^1</m>, that is, an ideal of <m>R</m>, and so it too is finitely generated by assumption (and Lemma ).

                <p>
                  Furthermore, by the first isomorphism theorem <m>M/\ker(\pi)\cong \pi(M)</m> is also finitely generated. 
                  By a homework problem, we deduce that <m>M</m> is a finitely generated module.

                  % I'll just sketch the general case (which I don't think we'll actually need): let <m>T</m> be any finitely generated <m>R</m>-module and <m>N \subseteq T</m> any submodule. % Since <m>T</m> is finitely generated, there exists a surjective <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>q: R^n \onto T</m> for some <m>n</m>. Then <m>q^{-1}(N)</m> is a submodule of <m>R^n</m> and % hence it is finitely generated by the case we already proved. Moreover, <m>q</m> induces a surjective <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>q: q^{-1}(N) \onto N</m>, % and hence <m>N</m> is isomorphic to a quotient of a finitely generated <m>R</m>-module and thus it is also finitely generated.

                  Then there is a sequence of elementary column and column operations that transform <m>A</m> into a matrix <m>S = [s_{i,j}]</m> such that all non-diagonal entries of <m>S</m> are <m>0</m> and the diagonal entries of <m>S</m> satisfy 
                  <me>

              </statement>
  
              <proof>
                <p>
                  Before we begin, note that we will apply a sequence of steps that correspond to multiplication by an invertible matrix on the left or right, and by <xref ref="lem-gcd-of-a-matrix-in-pid"/>, none of these steps will change the gcd.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  To prove existence of such a matrix <m>M</m>, we claim we can multiply <m>A</m> on the right and the left by invertible matrices to transform it into a matrix of the form
                  <me> 
                    \left[\begin{array}{ll} g &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; B \end{array}\right] 
                  </me>
                  for some <m>(n-1) \times(m-1)</m> matrix <m>B</m>, where <m>g=\operatorname{gcd}(A)</m>. 
                  If our claim holds, then we are done: notice that <m>g</m> divides every entry of <m>B</m>, since <m>\operatorname{gcd}(A)=\operatorname{gcd}(g, B)</m> by <xref ref="lem-gcd-of-a-matrix-in-pid"/>, and so by applying this fact to <m>B</m>, and then over and over again, we arrive at a matrix of the desired form <m>M</m>. 
                  Notice moreover that if <m>C</m> is an invertible matrix, then so is
                  <me> 
                    \left[\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; C \end{array}\right] 
                  </me>
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  To construct a matrix in the form above, let <m>a</m> be the upper left <m>(1,1)</m> entry of <m>A</m>. 
                  First, we are going to show that we can turn <m>A</m> into a matrix of the form
                  <me> 
                    \left[\begin{array}{ll} * &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; B \end{array}\right] 
                  </me>
                  with the same gcd as <m>A</m>. 
                  If a happens to divide all the entries on the first row and column, then we can simply apply elementary row and column operations to get to the desired form. 
                  Suppose there exists <m>b</m> on the first column such that <m>a \nmid b</m>. 
                  Then we may apply an elementary row operation switching rows so that <m>b=a_{2,1}</m> is on the first column, second row. 
                  By <xref ref="lem-gcd-two-by-two"/>, we can now find an invertible matrix <m>C \in \mathrm{M}_{2}(R)</m> such that
                  <me> 
                    C\left[\begin{array}{l} a \\ b \end{array}\right] =\left[\begin{array}{c} \operatorname{gcd}(a, b) \\ 0 \end{array}\right] . 
                  </me>
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  Consider the <m>m \times m</m> matrix
                  <me> 
                    P:=\left[\begin{array}{cc} C &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; I_{m-2} \end{array}\right] . 
                  </me>
                  Note that <m>P A</m> has <m>(P A)_{1,1}=\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)</m> and <m>(P A)_{2,1}=0</m>, so this step replaces <m>a</m> by <m>\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)</m> and <m>b</m> by 0 . 
                  By <xref ref="lem-gcd-of-a-matrix-in-pid"/>, <m>\operatorname{gcd}(P A)=\operatorname{gcd}(A)</m>. 
                  We can keep repeating this until the top left corner entry divides every entry on the first column, and this process must stop after at most <m>m-1</m> steps, since there are only <m>m</m> elements on the first column.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  Similarly, if there exists <m>b</m> on the first row that <m>a</m> does not divide, we can repeat this process by instead multiplying <m>A</m> on the left by an invertible matrix, until we zero out all the remaining entries on the first row and column. 
                  Finally, we arrive at a matrix of the form
                  <me> 
                    \left[\begin{array}{ll} a &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; B \end{array}\right] 
                  </me>
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  If <m>a=\operatorname{gcd}(A)</m>, we are done. 
                  If not, then we can find some entry <m>b=a_{i, j}</m> such that <m>a \nmid b</m>. 
                  We can then add the <m>j</m> th column to the first column, which puts <m>b</m> into the first column without affecting <m>a</m>, since the remainder of the top row is zero. 
                  But this brings us back to the previous situation, and we have already shown that we can replace the top left corner by <m>\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)</m>.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  At each step, we replace <m>a</m> by some <m>c</m> with is both a divisor of <m>a</m> and a multiple of <m>\operatorname{gcd}(A)</m>. 
                  Our ring <m>R</m> is a UFD, so there are finitely many factors of <m>a / \operatorname{gcd}(A)</m>, and this process must stop. 
                  This shows that we can eventually replace <m>A</m> by
                  <me> 
                    \left[\begin{array}{cc} \operatorname{gcd}(A) &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; B \end{array}\right]. 
                  </me>
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  Now it remains to show the uniqueness portion of the theorem. 
                  For any <m>i</m> and any matrix <m>B</m>, let <m>\operatorname{gcd}_{i}(B)</m> denote the gcd of all the <m>i \times i</m> minors of <m>B</m>. 
                  By <xref ref="lem-ideals-generated-by-minors"/>, <m>\operatorname{gcd}_{i}</m> is unchanged by row and column operations, so <m>\gcd_i(A) = \gcd_i(M )</m>.
                </p>
  
                <p>
                  For a matrix of the form <m>M</m>, the only minors that are nonzero are those where the choices of columns and rows are the same, and hence the only nonzero <m>i \times i</m> minors of <m>M</m> are <m>g_{s_{1}} \cdots g_{s_{i}}</m> for some <m>s_{1}&lt;\cdots&lt;s_{i}</m>. 
                  Since <m>g_{s_{1}} \cdots g_{s_{i}}</m> divide each other, it follows that
                  <me>\operatorname{gcd}_{i}(A)=\operatorname{gcd}_{i}(M)=g_{1} \cdots g_{i} .</me>
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  In particular, the largest value of <m>i</m> such that some <m>i \times i</m> minor of <m>A</m> is nonzero is <m>\ell</m>. 
                  Also, we have
                  <me>g_{i}=\frac{\operatorname{gcd}_{i}(A)}{\operatorname{gcd}_{i-1}(A)} .</me>
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  This proves uniqueness, for it shows that <m>\ell, g_{1}, \ldots, g_{\ell}</m> are all defined from <m>A</m> directly, without any choices.
                </p>
              </proof>
            </theorem>
  
            <remark>
              <p>
                Note that some of the diagonal entries could be <m>0</m>. 
                Recall <m>s \mid 0</m> for all <m>s \in R</m> (including <m>s = 0</m>), and <m>0</m> is the only element that divides <m>0</m>. 
                So, the âtail'' end of the sequence could be all <m>0</m>'s, and indeed if <m>s_{i,i} = 0</m> for some <m>i</m> then all subsequent diagonal entries must be <m>0</m>.

            </remark>

            <p>
              Elementary row and column operations correspond to multiplication by elementary matrices, which are invertible, and that the composition of invertible matrices is invertible. 
              So whenever we apply elementary row and column operations, we can translate it into multiplication by an invertible matrix on the left or the right, respectively.
            </p>

            <p>
              To transform a matrix <m>A</m> into its Smith Normal Form, we will use a sequence of steps that all correspond to multiplication by invertible matrices. 
              Many of those steps will actually be elementary row and column operations, which correspond to multiplication by an elementary matrix. 
              Elementary matrices are invertible, and a product of invertible matrices is invertible, and so any finite sequence of elementary row and column operations can be described by multiplication by an invertible matrix. 
              However, in general not every invertible matrix can be obtained as a product of elementary matrices. 
              In fact, there are examples of PIDs <m>R</m> and matrices <m>A</m> for which the Smith Normal Form cannot be obtained by simply taking a sequence of elementary row and column operations. 
              However, it is not easy to give such an example, in part because when our PID <m>R</m> is nice enough, the Smith Normal Form can in fact be obtained by simply taking a sequence of elementary row and column operations. 
              This is the case for Euclidean domains: over such rings, the Euclidean Algorithm for finding the gcd of two elements works, and it's the key step we will need to find a Smith Normal Form. 
              When <m>R</m> is a general PID, however, we need to work a little harder.
            </p>

            <example xml:id="ex-special-case-of-snf"><title>Special Case of SNF</title>
              <p>
                Suppose <m>R</m> is a Euclidean domain and <m>A = (x_1, \dots, x_n)</m> is a <m>1 \times n</m> matrix. Column operations of type I in this case amount to adding a multiple of one element in this list to another one. The SNF Theorem in this case amounts to the Euclidean algorithm: By adding a suitable multiple of the one entry in the first two positions to the other, in the usual back-and-forth way, we arrive at <m>(g_1, 0, x_3, \dots, x_n)</m> where <m>g_1 = \gcd(x_1, x_2)</m>. Repeat this for columns <m>1</m> and <m>3</m> to arrive at <m>(g_2, 0, 0, x_4, \dots, x_n)</m> where <m>g_2 = \gcd(g_1, x_3) = \gcd(x_1, x_2, x_3)</m>. Continuing in this fashion we arrive at <m>(g, 0, \dots, 0)</m> where <m>g = \gcd(x_1, \dots, x_n)</m>.

              <p>
                The proof of the SNF Theorem in general amounts to an extended version of the idea used in this special case.

                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  First, suppose that <m>n=1</m>, meaning that <m>A</m> is a column, say
                  <me>
                    A=\left[\begin{array}{c} a_{1} \\ \vdots \\ a_{m} \end{array}\right] 
                    \text { and let } 
                    P A=\left[\begin{array}{c} b_{1} \\ \vdots \\ b_{m} \end{array}\right]
                  </me>
                  We need to show that <m>\left(a_{1}, \ldots, a_{m}\right)=\left(b_{1}, \ldots, b_{m}\right)</m>. 
                  On the one hand, each <m>b_{i}</m> is a linear combination of the <m>a_{j}</m>, so <m>\left(b_{1}, \ldots, b_{m}\right) \subseteq\left(a_{1}, \ldots, a_{m}\right)</m>. 
                  On the other hand,
                  <me>
                    \left[\begin{array}{c} a_{1} \\ \vdots \\ a_{m} \end{array}\right]
                    =P^{-1}(P A)=P^{-1}
                    \left[\begin{array}{c} b_{1} \\ \vdots \\ b_{m} \end{array}\right]
                  </me>
                  so each <m>a_{j}</m> is a combination of the <m>b_{i}</m>, and <m>a_{j} \in\left(b_{1}, \ldots, b_{m}\right)</m>. 
                  We conclude that we have an equality of ideals <m>\left(a_{1}, \ldots, a_{m}\right)=\left(b_{1}, \ldots, b_{m}\right)</m>, and thus multiplying a column vector by an invertible matrix does not change the greatest common divisor of the entries.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  Now given <m>A \in \mathrm{M}_{m, n}(R)</m>, if we denote the <m>i</m> th column of <m>A</m> by <m>A_{i}</m>, we have
                  <me>
                    P A=\left[\begin{array}{lll}
                    P A_{1} &amp; \cdots &amp; P A_{m}
                    \end{array}\right] .
                  </me>
                  Since the gcd of each column remains the same, the gcd of all the entries does not change.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  To show that <m>\operatorname{gcd}(A Q)=\operatorname{gcd}(A)</m>, note that transposing a matrix does not change its gcd nor the fact that its invertible, so we can apply what we have already shown:
                  <me>\operatorname{gcd}(A Q)=\operatorname{gcd}\left((A Q)^{T}\right)=\operatorname{gcd}\left(Q^{T} A^{T}\right)=\operatorname{gcd}\left(A^{T}\right)=\operatorname{gcd}(A)</me>
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  Finally, applying elementary row and column operations corresponds to multiplying by an elementary matrix on the left or right, and elementary matrices are invertible.

                  </me>
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  By definition of greatest common divisor, <m>(x, y)=(\operatorname{gcd}(x, y))</m>, so there exist <m>a, b \in R</m> such that <m>a x+b y=\operatorname{gcd}(x, y)</m>. 
                  Write <m>g:=\operatorname{gcd}(x, y)</m> and <m>h=\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)</m>. 
                  Then <m>a x+b y</m> is a multiple of <m>g h</m>, but since <m>a x+b y=g</m> and <m>R</m> is a domain, we conclude that <m>h</m> must be a unit, and <m>(a, b)=(h)=(1)</m>. 
                  In particular, we can find <m>c, d \in R</m> such that <m>a d-b c=1</m>. Finally, <m>b x+c y \in(x, y)=(g)</m>, so
                  <me>
                    \left[\begin{array}{ll} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{array}\right]
                    \left[\begin{array}{l} x \\ y \end{array}\right]
                    =\left[\begin{array}{c} g \\ e g \end{array}\right]
                  </me>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Now we can apply the row operation that adds <m>-e</m> times the first row to the second row: by setting
                  <me>
                    P:=
                    \left[\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0 \\ -e &amp; 1 \end{array}\right]
                    \left[\begin{array}{ll} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{array}\right]
                    =\left[\begin{array}{cc} a &amp; b \\ c-e a &amp; b-d e \end{array}\right] .
                  </me>
                  we get
                  <me>
                    P\left[\begin{array}{l} x \\ y \end{array}\right]
                    =\left[\begin{array}{l} g \\ 0 \end{array}\right]
                  </me>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Finally, one can easily check that
                  <me>
                    P^{-1}=\left[\begin{array}{cc} d &amp; -b \\ -c &amp; a \end{array}\right]
                    \left[\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; 0 \\ e &amp; 1 \end{array}\right]
                  </me>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Recall that for a PID <m>R</m>, the gcd of any set of elements is defined to be a generatpr of the ideal they generate. 
                  So, <xref ref="lem-gcd-of-a-matrix-in-pid"/> implies that <m>\gcd_k(A) = \gcd_k(S)</m> for all <m>k</m>. 
                  Since <m>S</m> is diagonal, the only non-zero minors of <m>S</m> are those given by indices <m>1 \leq i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \leq m</m> and<m>1 \leq j_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; j_k \leq m</m> for which <m>i_t = j_t</m> for all <m>1 \leq t \leq k</m>, and moreover such a minor is equal to <m>d_{i_1} \cdots d_{i_k}</m>. 
                  Since <m>d_l \mid d_{l+1}</m> for all <m>l</m>, it follows that <m>d_{1} \cdots d_k</m> divides <m>d_{i_1} \cdots d_{i_k}</m> for all <m>1 \leq i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \leq n</m>. 
                  Thus <m>\gcd_k(S) = d_1 \cdots d_k</m>, for each <m>k</m>, and hence <m>d_k = \gcd_k(S)/\gcd_{k-1}(S)</m> as claimed.

                So, another way of finding the SNF of a matrix <m>A</m> with entries in a Euclidean domain is to calculate <m>\gcd_k(A)</m> for all <m>k</m>.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Let <m>R</m> be a PID and let <m>M</m> be a finitely generated module. 
                  Then there exist <m>r \geqslant 0</m>, <m>s \geqslant 0</m>, prime elements <m>p_{1}, \ldots, p_{s}</m> of <m>R</m> (not necessarily distinct), and <m>e_{1}, \ldots, e_{s} \geqslant 1</m> such that
                  <me>M \cong R^{r} \oplus R /\left(p_{1}^{e_{1}}\right) \oplus \cdots \oplus R /\left(p_{s}^{e_{s}}\right) .</me>
                  Moreover, <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> are uniquely determined by <m>M</m>, and the list <m>p_{1}^{e_{1}}, \ldots, p_{s}^{e_{s}}</m> is unique up to associates and reordering.                
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  First, using <xref ref="thm-ftfgmopidiff"/> write <m>M</m> in invariant factor form <m>M \cong R^{r} \oplus R /\left(d_{1}\right) \oplus \cdots \oplus R /\left(d_{k}\right)</m>. 
                  Then write each invariant factor as a product of prime powers
                  <me>d_{i}:=\prod_{j=n_{i}}^{n_{i+1}} p_{j}^{e_{j}},</me>
                  and recall that by the CRT we have
                  <me>R /\left(d_{i}\right) \cong R /\left(p_{n_{i}}^{e_{n_{i}}}\right) \oplus \cdots \oplus R /\left(p_{n_{i+1}}^{e_{n_{i+1}}}\right) .</me>
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  Substituting into the invariant factor form gives the desired result. 
                  Uniqueness follows from the uniqueness of the invariant factor form and of the prime factorizations of each <m>d_{i}</m>.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Suppose <m>I</m> and <m>J</m> are ideals in a commutative ring <m>R</m> such that <m>I + J = R</m>. 
                  Then <m>I \cap J = I \cdot J</m> (where <m>I \cdot J</m> is defined as the set of all sums of products of the form <m>ab</m> with <m>a \in I</m> and <m>b \in J</m>) and there is an isomorphism of <m>R</m>-modules 
                  <me>R/(I J) \cong R/I \oplus R/J.</me> 
                  In particular, if <m>R</m> is a UFD and <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are relatively prime elements of <m>R</m>, then

                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Note that <m>I \cdot J \subseteq I \cap J</m> holds in general for any pair of ideals. 
                  If <m>I + J = R</m> then <m>a + b = 1</m> for some <m>a \in I</m> and <m>b \in J</m>. 
                  Given <m>x \in I \cap J</m> we have <m>xa + xb = x</m> with <m>xa \in I \cdot J</m> and <m>xb \in I \cdot J</m>, which proves <m>x \in I \cdot J</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  For the second assertion define <m>g: R \to R/I \oplus R/J</m> to be the <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>g(r) = (r +I, r + J)</m>. 
                  Note that the kernel of <m>g</m> is <m>I \cap J</m> which equals <m>I\cdot J</m> by the first assertion. 
                  I claim <m>g</m> is onto: 
                  Pick <m>(x + I, y +J) \in R/I \oplus R/J</m>. 
                  With <m>a,b</m> chosen as above, we have 
                  <me> g(xb + ya) = (xb + ya + I, xb + ya + J) = (xb + I, ya + J) = (x + I, y +J).</me>
                  The last equation holds since <m>xa + xb = x</m> and thus <m>xb + I = xb + xa + I = x + I</m> and similarly <m>ya + J = y + J</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  For the final assertion, recall that when <m>R</m> is a UFD, two principle ideals <m>Rx</m> and <m>Ry</m> satisfy <m>Rx + Ry = R</m> if and only if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are relatively prime. 
                  Also, for <m>I = Rx</m> and <m>J = Ry</m>, we have <m>I\cdot J = R(xy)</m>.

              Given a vector space over a field, we can finagle it into an <m>F[x]</m> module instead.

                  It is onto since <m>v</m> generates <m>M</m> as a <m>\Q[x]</m>-module. 
                  The kernel will be a (necessarily principle) ideal of <m>\Q[x]</m>; we just need to find it.

                  This gives that <m>x^2 -2x + 1</m> is in the kernel of <m>\pi</m> and hence, by the <m>0</m>-th Isomorphism Theorem we have an induced homomorphism of <m>\Q[x]</m>-modules

                  The map <m>\ov{\pi}</m> is onto since <m>\pi</m> is onto.

                  Given a finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector space <m>V</m> and an <m>F</m>-linear operator <m>g: V \to V</m>, there is a basis <m>B</m> of <m>V</m> such that the matrix representing <m>g</m> relative to <m>B</m> is

                  Moreover, this matrix is unique, and is known as the <em>rational canonical form</em> of the operator <m>g</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  We know by the Fundamental Theorem of modules over <m>F[x]</m> (i.e., Corollary ) that there is a <m>F[x]</m>-module isomorphism 
                  <me>V_{g} \cong F[x]/(f_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s)</me> 
                  for some unique list of monic, non-constant polynomials <m>f_1, \cdots, f_s</m> with <m>f_i \mid f_{i+1}</m> for all <m>i</m>. 
                  Recall that the operator <m>g</m> on <m>V</m> is given as <m>\l_x</m> (multiplication by <m>x</m>) on <m>V_g</m>. 
                  Since this is a <m>F[x]</m>-module isomorphism, <m>g</m> corresponds to multiplication by <m>x</m> on each summand <m>F[x]/(f_i)</m>. 
                  As we have seen before, for each <m>i</m>, the matrix representing <m>\l_x</m> on <m>F[x]/f_i</m> relative to the basis <m>B_i := \{1, x, x^2, \dots, x^{\deg(f_i)-1}\}</m> of <m>F[x]/f_i</m> is the companion matrix <m>C(f_i)</m> of <m>f_i</m>. 
                  Let <m>B</m> be the <m>F</m>-basis of <m>F[x]/(f_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s)</m> given by tuples 
                  <me> B = \{(b_1, 0, \dots, 0) \mid b_1 \in B_1\} \cup \{(0, b_2, 0, \dots, 0) \mid b_2 \in B_{2\} \cup}\cdots \cup \{(0, 0, \dots, 0, b_s) \mid b_s \in B_s\} </me>
                  (in that order). 
                  Then the matrix of <m>\l_x</m> on <m>F[x]/(f_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_k)</m> for <m>B</m> is <m>C(f_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus C(f_s)</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  This gives existence. 
                  Uniqueness is a consequence of the uniqueness of the list <m>f_1, \dots, f_s</m>, but I will omit the details.
                </p>
              </proof>
            </theorem>

            <remark>
              <p>
                The matrix is unique, but the basis <m>B</m> that realizes it is, in general, not unique. 
                As an extreme example illustrating this: Take <m>g</m> to be the identity operator on a finite dimensional vector space <m>V</m>. 
                Then <m>[g]_B^B = I_n</m> holds for any basis <m>B</m>. 
                (Note that <m>I_n</m> is indeed in rational canonical form: it is equal to <m>C(x-1) \oplus \cdots \oplus C(x-1)</m>.)

                Recall that <m>\l_x</m> (multiplication by <m>x</m>) on <m>\Q^2_A</m> is given by multiplication by the matrix <m>A</m>.
                This is an isomorphism of <m>\Q[x]</m>-modules, and so <m>A</m> corresponds to the operator <m>\l_x</m> on <m>\Q[x]/(x^2 - 2x + 1)</m>. 
                As we have seen before, relative to the basis <m>\{1, x\}</m>, the matrix for <m>\l_x</m> is 
                <me>C(x^2 - 2x + 1) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; 2 \\ \end{bmatrix}.</me> 
                This is the Rational Canonical Form of <m>A</m>.

                The proof of Theorem <xref provisional="cite"/> CITEX makes clear the following fact:

                For a field <m>F</m>, finite dimensional vector space <m>V</m>, and <m>F</m>-linear operator <m>g: V \to V</m>,the invariant factors of the operator <m>g</m> are identical to the invariant factors of the <m>F[x]</m>-module <m>V_g</m>.
              </p>
            </remark>

            <p>
              The following result is thus very useful for finding the Rational Canonical Form of an operator (we will state it just for operators given explicitly by matrices):
            </p>

            <theorem xml:id="thm-rcf-and-cokernels"><title>RCF and Cokernels</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>A \in \Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>. 
                  The matrix <m>xI_n - A \in \Mat_{n \times n}(F[x])</m> presents the <m>F[x]</m>-module <m>F^n_A</m>; 
                  that is, there is an isomorphism of <m>F[x]</m>-modules 
                  <me>
                    F^n_A \cong \coker(xI_n -A) = F[x]^n/\im(xI_n - A).
                  </me>
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  For this proof it is useful to identity <m>F[x]^n</m> with <m>F^n[x]</m> where the latter refers to all expressions of the form <m>\sum_i v_i x^i = v_0 + v_1 x + \cdots + v_m x^m</m> with <m>v_i \in F^n</m>. 
                  For instance, (when <m>n = 2</m>) we identify <m>\vectwo{x^2 -3x + 1}{x^7 +x + 5}</m> with <m>\vectwo{1}{5} + \vectwo{-3}{1} x + \vectwo{1}{0} x^2 + \vectwo{0}{1} x^7</m>. Using this identification we define <me>\phi:  F[x]^n = F^n[x] \to F^n_A</me>by <m>\phi(\sum_i v_i x^i) = \sum_i A^i v_i</m>. Then <m>\phi</m> is a <m>F[x]</m>-module homomorphism â I leave it to you to verify this. <m>\phi</m> is onto since, e.g., for any <m>v \in F^n</m> we have <m>\phi(vx^0) = v</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  We have <me>\phi((xI_n - A) \cdot \sum_i v_i x^i) = \phi(\sum_i v_i x^{i+1} - \sum_i (Av_i) x^i) = \sum_i A^{i+1}(v_i) - \sum_i A^i(Av_i) = 0</me>and hence <m>\ker(\phi) \supseteq \im(xI_n - A)</m>. By the <m>0</m>-th isomorphism theorem, there is an induced <m>F[x]</m>-module homomorphism <me>\ov{\phi}: \frac{F^n[x]}{\im(xI_n - A)}  \onto F^n_A</me>induced by <m>\phi</m>, and it is onto since <m>\phi</m> is onto. It remains to show this map is one-to-one.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Since <m>\overline{\phi}</m> is <m>F[x]</m>-linear it is certainly <m>F</m>-linear. Since <m>\dim_F(F^n_A) = n</m>, to prove <m>\overline{\phi}</m> is one-to-one, it suffices to prove <m>\dim_F \frac{F^n[x]}{\im(xI_n - A)} \leq n</m> (by Rank-Nullity). I claim the images of the standard basis <m>e_1, \dots, e_n</m> in <m>\frac{F^n[x]}{\im(xI_n - A)}</m> span it as an <m>F</m>-vector space. To see this, note that <m>x^je_i</m>, for <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>, <m>j \geq 0</m> span <m>F^n[x]</m> as an <m>F</m>-vector space, and hence they span the quotient. It thus suffices to show <m>\overline{x^j e_i}</m> lies in the span of <m>\overline{e_1}, \dots, \overline{e_n}</m> in <m>\frac{F^n[x]}{\im(xI_n - A)}</m> for all <m>i</m> and <m>j</m>. We have <m>x^{j-1} \cdot (A - x) e_i \in \im(xI_n - A)</m> and thus <me>\overline{x^j e_i} = \overline{x^{j-1} Ae_i}</me>and by repeating this argument we have <me>\overline{x^j e_i} =\overline{x^{j-1} Ae_i} = \overline{x^{j-2} A^2e_i} = \cdots =\overline{A^je_i} \in \Span_F(e_1, \dots, e_n).</me>

Now some of the <m>d_i</m> might be non-zero constants, in which case <m>d_i</m> is a unit and <m>F[x]/(d_i) = 0</m>. Upon tossing those out, we are left with <me>F^n_A \cong F[x]/(f_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_k)</me>with each <m>f_i</m> monic of positive degree and <m>f_1 \mid \cdots \mid f_k</m>.

                  A sequence of messy row and column operations yields

                  Note that this is indeed in Smith Normal Form. 
                  It follows that the invariant factors of <m>A</m> are <m>x-1, x^2-1</m> and the RCF of <m>A</m> is

                  It's clear that <m>d_1 = 1</m> and an easy calculation gives that <m>\det(xI_3 - A) = (x-1)(x^2 -1)</m>. 
                  There are nine <m>2 \times 2</m> minors of <m>xI_3 - A</m>, and a tedious check reveals that each of them is one of <m>x^2 -1</m>, <m>x(x-1)</m>, <m>x-1</m> or <m>0</m> (up to signs). 
                  So <m>d_1d_2 = x-1</m>. 
                  We get that 
                  <me> d_1 = 1, d_2 = x-1, d_3 = x^2 -1 </me>

            <proof>
              <p>
                If <m>g(A) = 0</m>, then for each <m>v \in F^n</m>, by definition of the action of <m>F[x]</m> on <m>F^n_A</m> we have 
                <me>
                  g(x) \cdot v = g(A) v = 0
                </me> 
                and so <m>g(x)</m> annihilates <m>F^n_A</m>. 
                Conversely, if <m>g(x)</m> annihilates <m>F^n_A</m>, then <m>g(A) \cdot v = 0</m> for all <m>v \in F^n</m>. 
                Taking <m>v = e_i</m> for each <m>i</m>, this says that each column of <m>g(A)</m> is <m>0</m> and hence <m>g(A)</m> is the zero matrix.

            <proof>
              <p>
                The first assertion is a consequence of Corollary CITEX, since the product of the diagonal elements of the Smith Normal Form of <m>xI_n - A</m> is equal to the determinant of <m>xI_n - A</m>. 
                (Technically, we can only conclude at first that they are only associates, but since each is monic, they must be equal.)
              </p>
    
              <p>
                For the second, we use the isomorphism of <m>F[x]</m>-modules 
                <me>
                  V_g \cong F[x]/(f_1(x)) \oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s(x)). 
                </me> 
                Note that a polynomial <m>p(x)</m> annihilates <m>F[x]/(f_i(x))</m> if and only if <m>f_i(x)</m> divides <m>p(x)</m>. 
                Since <m>f_1 \mid \cdots \mid f_s</m>, the annihilator of the <m>F[x]</m>-module <m>F[x]/(f_1(x)) \oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s(x))</m> is generated by <m>f_s(x)</m>. 
                Thus the annihilator of <m>V_t</m> is also generated by <m>f_s(x)</m>, and by the Proposition  <m>f_s(x)</m> is the minimum polynomial of <m>t</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                The third assertion is an immediate consequence of the first two.

          <p>
            We now turn to the Jordan canonical form. 
            To motivate it, let us do an example.
          </p>

          <example xml:id="compantion-matrix-and-jordan-blocks"><title>Companion Matrix and Jordan Blocks</title>
            <p>
              Let us consider the companion matrix of <m>(x-2)^3 = x^3 -6x^2 + 12x -8</m>: 
              <me>
                A =
                \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -12 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 \end{bmatrix}=C((x-2)^3)\in \M_{3 \times 3}(\Q).
              </me> 
              We can interpret this matrix as arising from the linear transformation <m>g</m> on 
              <me>
                V := \Q[x]/(x-2)^3
              </me> 
              defined as multiplication by <m>x</m>. 
              Recall that the ordered basis of <m>V</m> that gives the matrix <m>A</m> as: 
              <me>
                B=\{\ov{1}, \ov{x}, \ov{x^2}\}.
              </me> 
              But notice that 
              <me>
                B'=\{\ov{1}, \ov{x-2}, \ov{(x-2)^2}\}
              </me> 
              is also a basis of <m>V</m>. 
              Let us calculate what the operator <m>g</m> does to this alternative basis. 
              We could work this out by brute force, but a cleaner way is to first compute what the operator <m>g -2 \cdot \id_V</m> does. 
              Since <m>g - 2 \cdot \id_V</m> is multiplication by <m>x-2</m>, it sends each basis element to the next one, except for the last one, which is sent to <m>0</m>. 
              It follows that the matrix of this operator relative to the ordered basis <m>B'</m> is 
              <me>
                [g - 2 \cdot \id_V]_{B'}^{B'} = 
                \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}
              </me> 
              and hence the matrix for <m>g</m> itself for this basis is 
              <me>
                [g]_{B'}^{B'} = 
                \begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\\end{bmatrix} =: J_3(2).
              </me> 
              This is what's known as a <em>Jordan Block</em>.

          <remark>
            <p>
              In this example, if we used the basis <m>\{ \ov{(x-2)^2}, \ov{x-2}, \ov{1}\}</m> instead we would have gotten the transpose of <m>J_3(2)</m>.

              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                The proof is similar to the proof the RCF theorem, using the idea of Example CITEX above, but starting with the FTFGMPIDEDF CITEX(instead of the FTFGMPIDIFF). 
                Here are the details:
              </p>

              <p>
                We consider the <m>F[x]</m>-module <m>V_g</m>. 
                Since we assume <m>\cp_g(x)</m> factors completely, the only irreducible polynomials in its factorization are linear. 
                Thus the invariant factors of <m>V_g</m> are products of polynomials of the form <m>(x-r)^e</m> for various <m>r \in F</m> and integers <m>e \geq 1</m>. 
                It follows that the elementary divisors have this form too. 
                The FTFGMPIDEDF CITEX therefore gives an isomorphism of <m>F[x]</m>-modules 
                <me> V_g\cong \frac{F[x]}{(x - r_1)^{e_1}} \oplus \frac{F[x]}{(x -r_2)^{e_2}} \oplus \cdots \oplus\frac{F[x]}{(x - r_s)^{e_s}}. </me>
                Now pick ordered bases <m>B_i=\{\ov{1}, \ov{x-r_i}, \ldots, \ov{(x-r_i)^{e_i-1}}\}</m> for each of the summands and set <m>B</m> to be their âordered union'' just as we did for the proof of the Theorem on RCF. CITEX
                By the same argument as in Example CITEX applied to each summand individually, the matrix representing multiplication by <m>x</m> on each summand is <m>J_{e_i}(r_i)</m>. 
                This gives the existence of the JCF.
              </p>

              <p>
                The uniqueness follows from the uniqueness clause in the FTFGMPIDEDF CITEX.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </theorem>

          <warning>
            <p>
              Not every operator has a Jordan Canonical Form: <xref ref="thm-jcf"/> only applies if <m>\cp_g(x)</m> factors completely, and, conversely, if an operator <m>g</m> is represented by any lower-triangular matrix, then its characteristic polynomial must be a product of linear polynomials. 
              For algebraically closed fields, such as <m>\C</m>, every linear operator does indeed have a JCF.
            </p>
          </warning>

          <remark>
            <p>
              If we flip the order of each <m>B_i</m> in the proof, we would end up with the transpose of what I have defined the JCF to be. 
              This is what our text does, and it defines the JCF as the transpose of what I have defined it to be.

                Note that a diagonal matrix is an example of a matrix in JCF. 
                By the uniqueness of the JCF, (1) holds if and only if (2) holds. 
                Moreover, the equivalence of (2) and (3) follows by definition. 
                A matrix has a JCF if and only if its invariant factors factor completely. 
                In this case, the elementary divisors are constructed by decomposing each invariant factor into powers of distinct linear polynomials. 
                This gives that (3) holds if and only if (4) holds. 
                Finally, since the minimal polynomial is one of the invariant factors and every other invariant factor divides it, we get the equivalence between (4) and (5).

                  Let <m>f(x), g(x) \in R[x]</m> where <m>R</m> is a PID. 
                  Then <m>\cont(fg) = \cont(f) \cont(g)</m> (up to associates).
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  We first show the following special case: 
                  If <m>\cont(f) = 1</m> and <m>\cont(g) = 1</m>, then <m>\cont(fg) =1</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To see this, pick a prime <m>p \in R</m> and write <m>\overline{f} \in (R/p)[x]</m> for the result of modding out the coefficients of <m>f</m> by <m>p</m>. 
                  Then <m>\ov{fg} = \ov{f}\ov{g}</m> (since the map <m>R[x] \to (R/p)[x]</m> sending <m>f</m> to <m>\ov{f}</m> is a ring map). 
                  Since <m>\cont(f) =1 = \cont(g)</m>, we have that <m>\ov{f} \ne 0</m> and <m>\ov{g} \ne 0</m>. 
                  Since <m>(R/p)[x]</m> is a domain, it follows that <m>\ov{fg} \ne 0</m>. 
                  This proves <m>p</m> does not divide all of the coefficients of <m>fg</m>. 
                  Since <m>p</m> was arbitrary, <m>\cont(fg) = 1</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For the general case, let <m>f = a h(x)</m> and <m>g = b l(x)</m> where <m>a =\cont(f)</m> and <m>b = \cont(g)</m>. 
                  Note that <m>\cont(h) = 1 = \cont(l)</m> and <m>fg = (ab) hl</m>. 
                  By the case already proven, <m>\cont(lh) =1</m>. 
                  It follows <m>\cont (abhl) =ab \cont(hl) = ab = \cont(f) \cont(g)</m>.

                  Let <m>R</m> be a PID and let <m>F</m> be its field of fractions, and assume <m>f(x) \in R[x]</m> is a non-constant polynomial with coefficients in <m>R</m>. 
                  <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible in <m>R[x]</m> if and only if it is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> and <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>.
                </p>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Suppose <m>f = gh</m> with <m>g, h \in F[x]</m>. 
                  We can find an element <m>M</m> of <m>R</m> such that <m>M \cdot g(x) \in R[x]</m>. 
                  (We can take <m>M</m> to be the product of all the denominators of the coefficients of <m>g</m>, for example; 
                  this is called âclearing denominators''.) 
                  Similarly, there is an <m>N \in R</m> such that <m>N \cdot h(x) \in R[x]</m>. 
                  Further, write <m>M \cdot g(x) = a \cdot l(x)</m> where <m>a = \cont(M g(x)) \in R</m>, <m>l(x) \in R[x]</m>, and <m>\cont(l) = 1,</m> and similarly <m>N \cdot g(x) = b \cdot m(x)</m> where <m>b = \cont(N h(x)) \in R</m>, <m>m(x) \in R[x]</m>, and <m>\cont(m) = 1</m>. 
                  We have 
                  <me>
                    abl(x)m(x) = MN f(x)
                  </me>
                  Using <xref text='title' ref="thm-gausss-lemma-part-1"/> we have <m>\cont(lm) = \cont(l) \cont(m) = 1</m> and hence 
                  <me>
                    \cont(ab l(x) m(x)) = ab \cont(l(x) m(x)) = ab.
                  </me> 
                  We also have <m>\cont(MNf(x)) = MN\cont(f) = MN</m> (since we've already proven that <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>).
                </p>

                <p>
                  So <m>ab = MN</m> and thus by dividing we arrive at 
                  <me>
                    l(x) m(x) = f(x).
                  </me> 
                  But <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible in <m>R[x]</m>. It follows that either <m>l</m> or <m>m</m> must be a unit in <m>R[x]</m> (i.e., a unit in <m>R</m>) and it follows that either <m>g(x)</m> or <m>h(x)</m> is a unit in <m>F[x]</m>. This proves <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>.
                </p>

                <p>

                Let's prove <m>f = x^4 + 7x^3 + 16 x^2 + 124 x + 23 \in \Q[x]</m> is irreducible. 
                By Gauss's Lemma, we just need to show it is irreducible in <m>\Z[x]</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                If <m>f</m> did factor in <m>\Z[x]</m> as a product of monic polynomials, then <m>\ov{f} \in \Z/2[x]</m> would also factor in this way. 
                Now <m>\ov{f} = x^4 + x^3 + 1 \in \Z/2[x]</m>. 
                This has no roots (the only possibilities are <m>0</m> or <m>1</m>) and so if it did factor it would have to factor as a product of two quadratic, irreducible polynomials. 
                The only such polynomial in <m>\Z/2[x]</m> is <m>q = x^2+ x + 1</m> (the others all have roots). 
                But <m>q^2 \ne \ov{f}</m>. 
                This proves <m>\ov{f}</m> is irreducible in <m>(\Z/2)[x]</m> and hence <m>f</m> must be irreducible in <m>\Z[x]</m>.

            <p>
              One motivation for studying field extensions is that we want to build fields in which certain polynomials have roots. 
              Here is a classical example going back to Gauss: while over <m>\mathbb{R}</m> the polynomial <m>f=x^{2}+1 \in \mathbb{R}[x]</m> has no roots, if we want a field in which <m>f</m> does have a root we need to consider <m>\mathbb{C}=\mathbb{R}(i)=\{a+b i \mid a, b \in \mathbb{R}\}</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Starting from a smaller field <m>F</m> and an irreducible polynomial <m>f \in F[x]</m>, we want to build a larger field <m>L</m>. 
              One way to do this is to take a root <m>a</m> of <m>f</m> and adjoin it to <m>F</m> obtaining the field <m>L=F(a)</m>, which is the collection of all expressions that one can build using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division starting from the of elements of <m>F \cup\{a\}</m>. 
              Another way to build a larger field <m>L</m> from a smaller field <m>F</m> and an irreducible polynomial <m>f \in F[x]</m> is to let <m>L=F[x] /(f(x))</m>. 
              We will show below that these two ways of creating larger fields are one and the same.

                  We will write either <m>F \subseteq L</m> or <m>L/F</m> to signify that <m>L</m> is a field extension of <m>F</m>.

                Recall that if <m>F</m> and <m>E</m> are fields, then every ring homomorphism <m>\phi: F \to E</m> necessarily injective. <xref provisional="empty"/>
                (Proof: since <m>\phi(1) = 1</m>, <m>\ker(\phi)</m> is a proper ideal of <m>F</m>, and since <m>F</m> is a field, the only proper ideal of it is <m>0</m>.) 
                Thus <m>\phi</m> maps <m>F</m> isomorphically onto its image <m>\phi(F)</m> and <m>\phi(F) \subseteq E</m> is a field extension. 
                By abuse of notation we will typically think of <m>\phi</m> as being a field extension, even though it is technically just an injective homomorphism of fields.

                <m>\Q \subseteq \R</m> and <m>\R \subseteq \C</m> are basic examples of field extensions.

                Recall <xref provisional="empty"/> CITEX that <m>\Q[\sqrt{2}] = \{a + b \sqrt{2} \mid a, b \in \Q\}</m> is a field. 
                So <m>\Q \subseteq \Q[\sqrt{2}]</m> is another example of a field extension.

              <p>
                The latter is a typical sort of example for us: 
                Starting with <m>\Q</m>, we would like to <q>adjoin</q> a root of the irreducible (in <m>\Q[x]</m>) polynomial <m>x^2 + 1</m>.

            <p>
              The previous example was a quadratic extension, which is misleadingly simple.

            <example xml:id="ex-more-field-extensions"><title>Yet More Field Extensions</title>
              <p>
                Consider <m>x^3 - 2 \in \Q[x]</m>. 
                It is irreducible (e.g., by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/>) and has roots <m>\a = \sqrt[3]{2}</m>, <m>\beta = e^{2 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}</m> and <m>\g = e^{4 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}</m> in <m>\C</m>. 
                So there are three ways in which we could âadjoin a root" to <m>\Q</m>: 
                First we could form the field 
                <me>
                  \Q[\a] = \{a + b \a + c \a^2 \mid a,b,c \in \Q\}.
                </me> 
                It is not completely obvious this is a field, but we'll prove it later. 
                The reason that we don't need third or higher powers is that, e.g., <m>\a^3 = 2 \in \Q</m>. 
                Or we could instead form the field <m>\Q[\beta]</m> or the field <m>\Q[\gamma]</m>. 
                There are not all equal since, for example, <m>\Q[\a] \subseteq \R</m> but <m>\beta</m> is not in <m>\R</m>. 
                However, they are {} field extensions as we will prove below.

                Then any expression of the form <m>\sum_i r_i \a^i</m> with <m>r_i \in \Q</m> is equal to one of the form <m>a + b \sqrt{2}</m> for <m>a, b \in \Q</m>.

                  Assume <m>F</m> is a field and <m>p(x) = \sum_i a_i x^i \in F[x]</m> is an irreducible polynomial. 
                  Set <m>L = F[x]/(p(x))</m>, and for <m>f \in F[x]</m>, let <m>\ov{f}</m> denote the coset <m>f(x) + (p(x)) \in L</m>. 
                  The following hold:

                <p>
                  Because <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible and <m>F[x]</m> is a PID, <m>(p(x))</m> is a maximal ideal <xref provisional="empty"/> CITEX. 
                  Thus <m>L = F[x]/(p(x))</m> is a field <xref provisional="empty"/> CITEX. 
                  The map <m>F \to L</m> given by <m>a \mapsto \ov{a}</m> is a ring map since it is the composition of the two ring maps <m>F \xra{can} F[x] \xra{can} F[x]/(p(x))</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. 
                  Since it is a ring map between two fields, it is injective <xref provisional="empty"/>CITEX.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  The equality <m>[L:F]=\deg(p)</m> holds since <m>1, \ov{x}, \dots, \ov{x^{\deg(p)-1}}</m> is a basis for <m>L</m> regarded as an <m>F</m>-vector space, as we have seen before <xref provisional="empty"/>.

                <p>
                  The last assertion is tricky only because the notation is confusing. 
                  Say <m>p(x) = a_n x^n + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0</m> and just to keep things straight let's set <m>q(y) = \ov{a_n} y^n + \cdots + \ov{a_0} \in L[y]</m>. 
                  We need to show <m>q(\ov{x}) = 0</m>: 
                  We have 
                  <me>
                    q(\ov{x}) = \sum_i \ov{a_i} (\ov{x})^i =\sum_i \ov{a_i} (\ov{x^i}) = \ov{\sum_i a_i x_i}= \ov{p(x)}= 0.

            <p>
              The last part of the proposition is notationally confusing to prove in general but clear in examples.

                Say <m>F = \R</m> and <m>p(x)= x^2 +1</m>. 
                Then <m>L = \R[x]/(x^2+1)</m>. 
                The assertion is that <m>\ov{x} := x + (x^2 + 1) \in L</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^2 + 1</m> viewed as having coefficients in <m>L</m>. 
                In other words, this element has the property that its square is <m>-1</m>. 
                Let's check: Since <m>\ov{x^2 + 1} = 0</m> and <m>\ov{x^2 + 1} = \ov{x}^2 + 1</m> we have <m>\ov{x}^2 = -1</m>. 
                Indeed, there is a field isomorphism <m>L \cong \C</m> sending <m>\ov{x}</m> to <m>i</m> and more generally <m>\ov{f}</m> to <m>f(i)</m>.

                  If <m>p</m> has a root <m>\alpha \in L</m>, then there is an isomorphism <m>\phi</m> with <m>\phi|_{F}=\mathrm{id}_{F}</m> and

                    \begin{gathered}
                    \frac{F[x]}{(p(x))} \longmapsto F(\alpha) \\
                    x+(p(x)) \longmapsto \alpha \\
                    f(x)+(p(x)) \longmapsto f(\alpha).

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>\tilde{\phi}: F[x] \rightarrow F(\alpha)</m> be the evaluation homomorphism that sends <m>x \mapsto \alpha</m>; 
                  more precisely, <m>\tilde{\phi}(f(x):=f(\alpha)</m>, and the restriction of this map to <m>F</m> is the identity on <m>F</m>. 
                  Since <m>p(\alpha)=0</m>, we have <m>(p(x)) \subseteq \operatorname{ker}(\tilde{\phi})</m>, and since <m>(p(x))</m> is a maximal ideal and <m>\operatorname{ker}(\tilde{\phi}) \neq F[x]</m>, we conclude that <m>(p(x))=\operatorname{ker}(\tilde{\phi})</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Now by Theorem 1.43 <xref provisional="cite"/> we get an injective ring homomorphism
                  <me>
                    \phi: \frac{F[x]}{(p(x))} \rightarrow F(\alpha)
                  </me>
                  such that <m>\phi(f(x)+(p(x)))=\tilde{\phi}(f(x))=f(\alpha)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It remains to be shown that <m>\phi</m> is surjective. 
                  We will actually show more, namely that <m>\operatorname{im}(\phi)=F[\alpha]=F(\alpha)</m>. 
                  Note first that by the definition of <m>\phi</m> above, the image of <m>\tilde{\phi}</m> on <m>F[x]</m> is <m>F[\alpha]</m>. 
                  However, since <m>\phi</m> is injective the image of <m>\tilde{\phi}</m> is a field contained in <m>F(\alpha)</m>, and since the smallest field containing <m>F[\alpha]</m> is <m>F(\alpha)</m>, we must in fact have <m>\operatorname{im}(\tilde{\phi})=F(\alpha)</m>.

                <p>
                  Let <m>\phi: F[x] \to L</m> be the evaluation homomorphism, given by sending <m>f(x)</m> to <m>f(\a)</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. 
                  Note that <m>\phi</m> satisfies <m>\phi|_F = \id_F</m> and <m>\phi(x) = \alpha</m>. 
                  We have <m>\im(\phi) = F[\a]</m> by definition of the latter. 
                  The <xref text="title" ref="thm-ring-fit"/> thus gives that <m>\phi</m> induces a ring isomorphism

                  In particular, since <m>F[\a]</m> is a subring of <m>L</m>, it is an integral domain, <xref provisional="empty"/> and hence <m>I</m> must be a prime ideal (possibly the <m>0</m> ideal). <xref provisional="empty"/>

                  For (3) assume <m>\a</m> is algebraic. 
                  Then <m>I \ne 0</m> and hence it has a unique monic generator, which we write <m>m_{\a, F}(x)</m>. 
                  Since <m>I</m> is prime, <m>m_{\a, F}(x)</m> is irreducible <xref provisional="empty"/>; this proves (3a). 
                  Also, this shows that <m>\frac{F[x]}{(m_{\a,F}(x))}</m> is a field <xref provisional="empty"/> and hence so is <m>F[\a]</m>. 
                  Since <m>F[\a] \subseteq F(\a)</m>, <m>F[\a]</m> contains <m>F</m> and <m>\a</m>, and <m>F[\a]</m> is a field, we must have <m>F[\a] = F(\a)</m>. 
                  This proves (3b) and (3c).
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  For (4), if <m>\a</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, then <m>[F(\a):F] = \deg(m_{\a, F}(x)) &lt; \infty</m> by (3b) and Proposition <xref provisional="empty"/>. 
                  For the converse, if <m>[F(\a): F] &lt; \infty</m>, then the infinite list <m>1, \a, \a^2, \dots</m> of elements of <m>F(\a)</m> cannot be <m>F</m>-linearly independent <xref provisional="empty"/>. 
                  So, <m>a_0 + a_1 \a + \cdots a_n \a^n = 0</m> for some <m>n</m> and some <m>a_0, \dots, a_n \in F</m> not all of which are <m>0</m>. 
                  This shows <m>\a</m> is the root of a non-zero polynomial.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  For (5), if <m>\a</m> is transcendental, then <m>I = 0</m> and so <m>\phi: F[x] \into L</m> is injective. 
                  Since <m>L</m> is a field, <m>F[x]</m> is a domain <xref provisional="empty"/>, and <m>\phi</m> is injective <xref provisional="empty"/>, it can be extended to the field of fractions <m>F(x)</m> of <m>F[x]</m>, i.e. there is a ring homomorphism 
                  <me>
                    \tilde{\phi}: F(x) \to L

                <p>
                  Let <m>A \subseteq K</m> be a basis for <m>K</m> as an <m>L</m>-vector space and let <m>B \subseteq L</m> be a basis for <m>L</m> as an <m>F</m>-vector space. 
                  Let <m>AB</m> denote the subset <m>\{ab \mid a \in A, b \in B\}</m> of <m>K</m>. 
                  The Theorem follows from the following two facts:

                  Concerning (a), for <m>\a \in K</m>, we have <m>\a = \sum_i l_i a_i</m> for some <m>a_1, \dots, a_m \in A</m> and <m>l_1, \dots, l_m \in L</m>. 
                  For each <m>i</m>, <m>l_i</m> is an <m>F</m>-linear combination of a finite set of elements of <m>B</m>. 
                  Combining these gives that <m>\a</m> is in the <m>F</m>-span of <m>AB</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  To prove linear independence, it suffices to prove that if <m>a_1, \dots, a_m</m> and <m>b_1, \dots, b_n</m> be distinct elements of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> respectively, then the set <m>\{a_ib_j\}</m> is linearly independent. 
                  Suppose <m>\sum_{i,j} f_{i,j} a_i b_j = 0</m> for some <m>f_{i,j} \in F</m>. 
                  Since the <m>b_j</m>'s are <m>L</m>-linearly independent and 
                  <me>
                    \sum_{i,j} f_{i,j} a_i b_j = \sum_j (\sum_i f_{i,j} a_i) b_j
                  </me>
                  and <m>f_{i,j} a_i \in L</m>, we get that, for each <m>j</m>, <m>\sum_i f_{i,j} a_i = 0</m>. 
                  Using now that the <m>a_i</m>'s are <m>F</m>-linearly independent, we have that for all <m>j</m> and all <m>i</m>, <m>f_{i,j} = 0</m>. 
                  This proves <m>\{a_i b_j \mid i = 1, \dots, m, j = 1, \dots, n\}</m> is linearly independent over <m>F</m>, and hence <m>AB</m> is linearly independent over <m>F</m>.

                  Concerning (b), if <m>ab = a'b'</m> for some <m>a,a' \in A, b, b' \in B</m>, then <m>ab - a'b' = 0</m>, and since the <m>b</m>'s are <m>L</m>-linearly independent, we must have <m>b = b'</m> and hence <m>a = a'</m>.

                Say <m>F \subseteq L</m> is a field extension of prime degree <m>p</m>.

                It follows that <m>[L: F(w)] = 1</m>, whence <m>L = F(w)</m>. 
                As a (very simple) example of this, since <m>[\C: \R]</m> is prime, <m>\R(w) = \C</m> for any complex number <m>w</m> that is not real.

                Let <m>F</m> be the result of adjoining to <m>\Q</m> all of the roots in <m>\C</m> of <m>x^2 - 5</m>. 
                That is, <m>F = \Q(\a_1, \a_2, \a_3, \a_4)</m> where <m>\a_1 = \sqrt[4]{5}</m>, <m>\a_2 = i \sqrt[4]{5}</m>, <m>\a_3 = -\sqrt[4]{5}</m>, and <m>\a_4 = - i \sqrt[4]{5}</m>. 
                As we shall see later, <m>F</m> is an example of a âsplitting field". 
                Let's find <m>[F: \Q]</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                First, let us note that we can also describe <m>F</m> as <m>F = \Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)</m>. 
                This holds since each of <m>\a_1, \dots, \a_4</m> belongs to <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)</m> and hence <m>F \subseteq \Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)</m>. 
                The opposite containment holds because <m>\sqrt[4]{5}, i \in F</m>, with the latter being true because <m>i = \a_2/\a_1</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Set <m>E = \Q(i)</m>. 
                Then <m>[E: \Q] = 2</m>. 
                Since <m>F = E(\sqrt[4]{5})</m> and <m>\sqrt[4]{5}</m> is a root of <m>x^4-5</m>, we have <m>[F : E]</m> is at most <m>4</m> and it will be exactly <m>4</m> if and only if <m>x^4 -5</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>. 
                This is unclear.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                So instead let's try a different approach. 
                Let <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[4]{5})</m>. 
                Then since <m>x^4 - 5</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/>, we have <m>[L: \Q] = 4</m>. 
                Since <m>F = L(i)</m> and <m>i</m> is a root of <m>x^2 +1</m>, we have <m>[F:L] \leq 2</m>. 
                But <m>F \ne L</m> since <m>F \subseteq \R</m>. Note that <m>[F:L] = 1</m> if and only if <m>F = L</m>. 
                Thus <m>[F:L] = 2</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we conclude that 
                <me>
                  [F: \Q] = [F:L][L:\Q] = 2 \cdot 4 = 8.
                </me> 
                Note that, in hindsight, it must have been true that <m>x^4 - 5</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>, since otherwise the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> would give that <m>[F: \Q] &lt; 8</m>.

                  By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/>, <m>[F(a_0, \dots, a_{n}, \a): F]</m> is finite and thus so is <m>[F(\a):F]</m>. 
                  By the Theorem CITEX again, <m>\a</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Next suppose that <m>L/F</m> is algebraic. 
                  Let <m>\a\in K</m>. 
                  Then <m>\a\in L</m>, and so it is algebraic over <m>F</m>. 
                  Now let <m>\b\in L</m>. 
                  Then <m>\b</m> is the root of a polynomial in <m>F</m>, which is also in <m>K</m>, so <m>L/K</m> is algebraic as well.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  <m>K=\Q(\sqrt{2})</m> is Galois over <m>F=\Q</m>, and <m>L=\Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt[4]{2})</m> is Galois over <m>K</m>, but <m>L</m> is not Galois over <m>F,</m> as the splitting field of <m>x^4-2</m> has degree <m>8</m>.

              <p>
                The converse of this proposition is also true: 
                Given field extensions <m>F \subseteq L \subseteq E</m>, if <m>F \subseteq E</m> is algebraic then so are <m>L \subseteq E</m> and <m>F \subseteq L</m>.

                  More generally, if <m>F \subseteq L</m> is a field extension and <m>L</m> is algebraically closed, then the collection <m>\ov{F}</m> of elements of <m>L</m> that are algebraic over <m>F</m> is an algebraic closure of <m>F</m>.

                  It is far from clear that <m>\ov{F}</m> is a subfield of <m>L</m>, and so we first prove that: Given <m>\a, \beta \in \ov{F}</m>, we have that <m>[F(\a): F]</m> and <m>[F(\a, \beta): F(\a)]</m> are finite and hence so is <m>[F(\a, \beta): F]</m>. Thus, every element of <m>F(\a, \beta)</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>; that is, <m>F(\a, \beta) \subseteq \ov{F}</m>. Since <m>F(\a, \beta)</m> is a field, it follows that <m>\ov{F}</m> contains <m>\a \pm \beta</m>, <m>\a \cdot \beta</m> and <m>\a^{-1}</m> if <m>\a \ne 0</m>. This proves that <m>\ov{F}</m> is indeed a subfield of <m>L</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  It is clear from the definition that <m>F \subseteq \ov{F}</m> is an algebraic field extension.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Given a non-constant <m>g(x) \in \ov{F}[x]</m>, let <m>\a</m> be one of its roots in <m>L</m> (which exists since we assume <m>L</m> is algebraically closed). Then <m>\ov{F} \subseteq \ov{F}(\a)</m> is an algebraic extension and hence so is <m>F \subseteq \ov{F}(\a)</m> by Proposition . This proves <m>\a \in \ov{F}</m> and hence that <m>\ov{F}</m> is algebraically closed.

                  Using that <m>\cT</m> is totally ordered, it is not hard to see that <m>K</m> is indeed a field. 
                  It clearly contains <m>F</m> as a subfield and every element of it is algebraic over <m>F</m>. 
                  So <m>K \in \cS</m> and it is an upper bound for <m>\cT</m>.

                  But then <m>F \subseteq E</m> is algebraic by Proposition <xref provisional="cite"/>, and this contradicts the maximality of <m>L</m>.

                  Why is this only a fake proof?

                <p>
                  First, note that if <m>d=1</m> then <m>f(x)</m> will remain irreducible in <m>K[x]</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. 
                  Suppose then that <m>d&gt;1</m>. 
                  There exists an algebraically closed extension <m>\widetilde F</m> such that <m>f</m> has a root <m>r</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. 
                  Consider <m>K(r)</m>. 
                  As <m>r</m> is algebraic in <m>K(r)</m> we know there exists some unique irreducible minimum polynomial <m>g</m> of degree <m>q</m>, and thus that <m>[K(r):K]=q</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. 
                  Using the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we see that

                    [K(r):F]=[K(r):K][K:F]=qn.

                  However, <m>[K(r):F]=[K(r):F(r)][F(r):F]</m> and so <m>qn=md</m> for some <m>m\in\Z</m>, so <m>d|qn</m>. 
                  As <m>\gcd(n,d)=1</m> we must have <m>d|q</m>. 
                  But <m>q</m> was defined to be the degree of <m>g</m>, which divides <m>f</m>. 
                  As <m>d|q</m> and <m>q\leq d</m>, we see that <m>d=q</m>, so <m>f=kg</m> for some <m>k\in F</m>. 
                  As irreducible polynomials multiplied by a constant are still irreducible, we see that <m>f</m> is indeed irreducible in <m>K[x]</m>.

              The statement in part (a) would become false if the assumption that <m>\gcd(n, d) = 1</m> were omitted.

                Let <m>K=F[x]/p(x)</m>. 
                Because <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible and <m>F[x]</m> is a PID, <m>(p(x))</m> is a maximal ideal. 
                Thus <m>K = F[x]/(p(x))</m> is a field <xref provisional="empty"/>, <m>[K:F]=d</m>, and <m>x+p(x)</m> is a root of <m>p(x)</m> in <m>K</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>.

                More generally, we may speak of the splitting field of a list of polynomials in <m>F[x]</m>: it is a field extension over which each polynomial factors completely and which is generated by all the roots of all the polynomials.

                  For (1), let <m>\ov{F}</m> be an algebraic closure of <m>F</m>, which exists by the previous Theorem. 
                  Let <m>\a_1, \dots, \a_m</m> be the roots of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>\ov{F}</m>, and set <m>L = F(\a_1, \dots, \a_m)</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  It is clear <m>L</m> is a splitting field.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  To prove (2), we proceed by induction on the degree of <m>f(x)</m>. 
                  If <m>f</m> is linear, then the only splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>F</m> is <m>F</m> itself and so the result is clear in this case. 
                  Say <m>\a_1, \dots, \a_m</m> and <m>\a'_1, \dots, \a'_m</m> are the roots of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m>, respectively, and say they are ordered so that, <m>\a_m</m> and <m>\a'_m</m> are roots of the same irreducible factor of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  By Corollary  there is an isomorphism <m>\phi: F(\a_n) \xra{\cong} F(\a_n')</m> that fixes <m>F</m>. 
                  Note that <m>f(x)</m> factors as <m>(x-\a_n) g(x)</m> in <m>F(\a_n)[x]</m> and that <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>g(x)</m> over <m>F(\a_n)</m>, and similarly <m>f(x)</m> factors as <m>(x-\a'_n) g'(x)</m> in <m>F(\a'_n)[x]</m> and that <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>g'(x)</m> over <m>F(\a'_n)</m>. 
                  If we blur our eyes slightly and pretend <m>\phi</m> is the identity map, we can apply the inductive hypothesis, since <m>\deg(g) &lt; \deg(f)</m>, to conclude that there is an isomorphism <m>\s</m> as in the statement.
                  I leave a more rigorous argument to your imaginations.

                <p>
                  To prove (3), we also proceed by induction on the degree of <m>f</m>, using the same notation as in the proof of (2).

                <p>
                  Since <m>\a_n</m> is a root of <m>f(x)</m>, we have <m>m_{F,\a_n} \mid f(x)</m> and hence 
                  <me>
                    [F(\a_n): F] = \deg(m_{F,\a_n})  \leq n.
                  </me> 
                  In <m>F(\a_n)</m> we have <m>f(x) = (x-\a_n) g(x)</m> with <m>g(x) \in F(\a_n)[x]</m> and, as before, <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>g(x)</m> over <m>F(\a_n)</m>, so that by induction <m>[L: F(\a_n)] \leq (n-1)!</m>. 
                  By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> 
                  <me>
                    [L: F] = [L: F(\a_n)][F(\a_n): F] \leq (n-1)! \cdot n = n!.

                Recall from before that we proved there exists a field extension <m>F \subseteq E</m> in which <m>f(x)</m> has at least one root. So <m>f(x) = (x-\a_1) g(x)</m> for some <m>\a_1 \in E</m> and <m>g(x) \in E[x]</m>. 
                We can then find a field extension of <m>E</m> in which <m>g</m> has at least one root <m>\a_2</m>, and so on. 
                In this way we build a field extension <m>F \subseteq K</m> such that <m>g</m> factors in <m>K</m> as <m>c\prod_{i=1}^n (x - \a_i)</m> for some <m>c, \a_1, \dots, \a_n \in K</m>. 
                Finally, <m>L = F(\a_1, \dots, \a_n)</m> is a splitting field of <m>f</m>.

                The splitting field <m>L</m> of <m>x^3 -2</m> over <m>\Q</m> is <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3 \sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3^2 \sqrt[3]{2})</m>, where <m>\zeta_3 = e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{3}}</m>. 
                It is not hard to see that <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3)</m>. 
                We have <m>[\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}): \Q] = 3</m> since <m>x^3 - 2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> (by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/>). 
                Since <m>\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}) \subseteq \R</m> and thus <m>\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}) \ne L</m>, the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> gives that <m>[L: \Q] \geq 6</m>. 
                By the Theorem, <m>[L: \Q] \leq 6</m> and hence <m>[L: \Q] = 6</m>. 
                (We could also have proven this without appealing to the Theorem.)

                The splitting field of <m>f(x) = x^4 - 5x^2 + 6</m> is 
                <me>
                  \Q(\sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, -\sqrt{3}) = \Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) = \Q(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}).
                </me> 
                This holds since <m>f(x) = (x^2-3)(x^2-2)</m>. 
                It is not too hard to see that the degree of this splitting field over <m>\Q</m> is <m>4</m>, far smaller than the <m>4!</m> upper bound given by the Theorem.

              <p>
                Let <m>f(x) = x^n -1 \in \Q[x]</m>. 
                Then <m>f(x)</m> splits completely in <m>\C[x]</m> and its roots are the <m>n</m> <m>n</m>-th roots of <m>1</m>. 
                One of these is <m>\zeta_n := e^{2 \pi i/n}</m>. 
                Notice that every other <m>n</m>-th root of <m>1</m> is a power of this one. 
                We thus see that <m>\Q(\zeta_n)</m> is the splitting field of <m>x^n-1</m> over <m>\Q</m>. 
                This field is called the {} of <m>n-th</m> roots of 1 over <m>\Q</m>. 
                This is a somewhat special example: upon joining one of the roots of <m>f</m> we got all the others for free. 
                This happens in other examples too, but is certainly {} a general principle.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                In particular, we see that the degree of <m>\Q \subseteq \Q(\zeta_n)</m> is at most <m>n</m>, far less than the bound of <m>n!</m> given by the Proposition above. 
                In fact, it is at most <m>n-1</m> since <m>f</m> factors as <m>(x-1)(x^{n-1} + \cdots + x + 1)</m>, and hence the minimum polynomial of <m>\zeta_n</m> is a divisor of <m>x^{n-1} + \cdots + x + 1</m>.

              <p>
                When <m>n = p</m> is prime, then <m>x^{p-1} + \cdots + x + 1</m> is irreducible, as we proved before, and hence it must equal the minimum polynomial of <m>\zeta_p</m>. 
                So, in this case, the degree of <m>\Q \subseteq \Q(\zeta_p)</m> is exactly <m>p-1</m>, but it can be smaller than <m>n-1</m> in general; 
                for example, when <m>n = 4</m>, <m>\zeta_4= i</m> and <m>[\Q(i): \Q] = 2</m>. Note that <m>x^3 + x^2 + x + 1</m> factors as <m>(x^2+1)(x+1)</m> and of course <m>m_{i, \Q}(x) = x^2 + 1</m>.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  For the first assertion, consider the unique ring homomorphism <m>\varphi:\Z \to F</m>. 
                  Since <m>F</m> is a domain, the kernel of <m>\varphi</m> is a prime ideal (since <m>\Z/\ker(\varphi) \cong \im(\varphi)</m> and <m>\im(\varphi)</m> is a subring of <m>F</m>). 
                  The result holds since the only prime ideals of <m>\Z</m> are <m>(0)</m> and <m>(p)</m> for a prime integer <m>p</m>. 
                  (Note that this proof shows that, more generally, the characteristic of an integral domain must be either <m>0</m> or a prime.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  For the second assertion, observe that the smallest {} of <m>F</m> is the image of the ring map <m>\varphi: \Z \to F</m>, and by the first assertion, this image is isomorphic to either <m>\Z</m> or <m>\Z/p</m>. 
                  The latter is already a field and hence it is the prime field of <m>F</m>. 
                  In the former case, the prime subfield is isomorphic to the field of fractions of <m>\Z</m>, which is <m>\Q</m>.

                  If <m>F</m> and <m>E</m> are fields such that <m>\char(F) \ne \char(E)</m> then there exist no ring homomorphisms from <m>E</m> to <m>F</m> (or vice versa).

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Suppose <m>F</m> and <m>E</m> are fields and <m>\s: F \to E</m> is a ring homomorphism. 
                  Let <m>\phi_F: \Z \to F</m> and <m>\phi_E: \Z \to E</m> be the unique ring maps from <m>\Z</m> to <m>F</m> and <m>E</m>. 
                  Since <m>\s \circ \phi_F</m> is a ring map from <m>\Z</m> to <m>E</m>, we have <m>\s \circ \phi_F = \phi_E</m> by the uniqueness of <m>\phi_E</m>. 
                  Since <m>F</m> is a field and <m>E</m> is not the zero ring, the map <m>\s</m> is injective. 
                  Since <m>\s</m> is injective, it follows that <m>\ker(\s \circ \phi_F) = \ker(\phi_F)</m>, and hence we obtain that <m>\ker(\phi_F) = \ker(\phi_E)</m>. 
                  By definition of characteristic, we conclude <m>\ker(E) = \ker(F)</m>.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  If <m>\char(F) = 0</m>, then every algebraic field extension <m>F \subseteq L</m> is separable.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Suppose <m>F\subseteq L</m> is an algebraic extension and let <m>\alpha\in L</m> be algebraic over <m>F</m>. 
                  Then the minimal polynomial <m>f(x)</m> of <m>\alpha</m> over <m>F</m> has coefficients in <m>F</m> and is of the form 
                  <me>
                    f(x) = x^m + a_{m-1} x^{m-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0
                  </me> 
                  where <m>a_i \in F</m>. 
                  We need to show that <m>f(x)</m> is separable, i.e., has no repeated roots in its splitting field.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Suppose <m>f(x)</m> has a repeated root <m>\beta</m> in some splitting field <m>K</m> of <m>f(x)</m>, i.e., <m>f(x) = (x-\beta)^2 g(x)</m> for some polynomial <m>g(x) \in K[x]</m>. 
                  Since <m>\alpha</m> is also a root of <m>f(x)</m>, we have <m>(\alpha - \beta)^2 g(\alpha) = 0</m>. 
                  Since <m>F\subseteq L</m> is an algebraic extension, <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, so <m>g(\alpha)\neq 0</m>. 
                  It follows that <m>(\alpha-\beta)^2=0</m>, i.e., <m>\alpha=\beta</m>, which means that <m>\alpha</m> is a repeated root of <m>f(x)</m>, contradicting the assumption that <m>f(x)</m> has no repeated roots. 
                  Hence <m>f(x)</m> is separable, and since <m>\alpha</m> was an arbitrary algebraic element of <m>L</m>, we conclude that <m>F\subseteq L</m> is a separable extension.
                </p>
              </proof>
            </corollary>

            <example xml:id="ex-f-zpy-subseteq-zpz-l"><title><m>F = (\Z/p)(y) \subseteq (\Z/p)(z) = L</m></title>
              <p>
                Let <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> be indeterminants. 
                The extension of fields <m>F = (\Z/p)(y) \subseteq (\Z/p)(z)= L</m> given by identifying <m>y</m> with <m>z^p</m> is not separable. 
                Somewhat more precisely, <m>F</m> is isomorphism to the subfield of <m>L</m> consisting of elements of the form <m>\frac{\sum_i a_i z^{ip}}{\sum_j b_j z^{jp}}</m>, with the isomorphism given by sending <m>\frac{\sum_i a_i y^{i}}{\sum_j b_j y^{j}}</m> to <m>\frac{\sum_i a_i z^{ip}}{\sum_j b_j z^{jp}}</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Then <m>z \in L</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^p - y \in F[x]</m>. 
                Moreover since <m>F</m> is the field of fractions of the PID <m>R = (\Z/p)[y]</m> and <m>y</m> is a prime element of <m>R</m>, we may apply <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> (and Gauss) to conclude that <m>x^p - y</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>. 
                This proves that <m>m_{z, F}(x) = x^p - y</m>. 
                This polynomial is not separable since in <m>L[x]</m> it is equal to <m>(x-z)^p</m> and hence has a repeated root. 
                (Or, you may use that its derivative is <m>0</m>.)

                I claim <m>\Aut(\C/\R)</m> has two elements (and so is a cyclic group of order <m>2</m>): 
                the identity map on <m>\C</m> and the element <m>\s</m> given as complex conjugation. 
                Each of these is an element of <m>\Aut(\C/\R)</m> â for <m>\s</m>, this amounts to the fact that complex conjugation commutes with addition and multiplication of complex numbers (and that it sends <m>1</m> to <m>1</m>).

                      <p>
                        This action is faithful: if <m>\sigma</m> fixes all the roots <m>\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}</m> of <m>f</m>, then it fixes every element of <m>F\left(\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}\right)=L</m>. 
                        Thus the corresponding group homomorphism <m>\operatorname{Aut}(L / F) \rightarrow \operatorname{Aut}(S)</m> is injective. 
                        On the other hand, the group of automorphisms on a set of <m>n</m> elements is isomorphic to <m>S_{n}</m>, so we have an inclusion of <m>\operatorname{Aut}(L / F)</m> into <m>S_{n}</m>, and thus <m>\operatorname{Aut}(L / F)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_{n}</m>.

In particular, <m>\sigma</m> fixes <m>F</m>, since <m>\sigma</m> extends <m>\theta</m> and <m>\left.\theta\right|_{F}=\operatorname{id}_{F}</m>, so <m>\sigma \in \operatorname{Aut}(L / F)</m>. Moreover, since <m>\sigma</m> extends <m>\theta</m> we have <m>\sigma(\alpha)=\theta(\alpha)=\beta</m>. This proves the action is transitive on the set of roots of any irreducible polynomial.

              Soon we will show that if <m>f \in F[x]</m> is separable but not necessarily irreducible, and <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>f</m>, then the orbits of the action of <m>\operatorname{Aut}(L / F)</m> on the set of roots of <m>f</m> are precisely the sets of roots of the same irreducible factor of <m>f</m>. 
              But to do so, we will need a little bit of Galois theory.

              A typical question that arises from <xref ref="thm-field-aut-action"/> is to explicitly identify the automorphisms of a splitting field extension as a subgroup of the symmetric group.
            </p>
            
            <example xml:id="ex-aut-and-x3-2"><title><m>\Aut</m> and <m>(x^3-2)</m></title>
              <p>
                For a more complicated example, let <m>K</m> be the splitting field of <m>x^3 - 2</m> over <m>\Q</m>. 
                Recall 
                <me>
                  K= \Q(\a_1, \a_2, \a_3)
                </me> 
                <me>
                  \a_1 = \sqrt[3]{2}, \a_2 = e^{2 \pi i/3}\sqrt[3]{2}, \a_3 = e^{4 \pi i/3}\sqrt[3]{2}.
                </me> 
                Let us ponder how big <m>\Aut(K/\Q)</m> could be. 
                Pick any <m>\s \in \Aut(K/\Q)</m>. 
                Since <m>\s</m> is a ring homomorphism, for any <m>i</m> we have 
                <me>
                  \s(\a_i)^3 = \s(\a_i^3) = \s(2) = 2
                </me> 
                and thus <m>\s(\a_i)</m> is also a root of <m>x^2 - 2</m>. 
                In other words, for each <m>i</m> we have <m>\s(\a_i) = \a_j</m> for some <m>j</m>. 
                Moreover, since <m>K</m> is generated as a field extension of <m>\Q</m> by <m>\a_1, \a_2, \a_3</m>, the action of <m>\s</m> on the three roots completely determines the action of <m>\s</m> on all of <m>K</m>. 
                In more detail, every element of <m>K</m> is given taking <m>\Q</m>-linear combinations of sums and products and quotients of these roots, and any element of <m>\Aut(K/\Q)</m> preserves sums, products and <m>\Q</m>-linear combinations.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                To summarize, we have proven that there are {} <m>3! = 6</m> possibilities for <m>\s</m>. 
                In fact, more is true: 
                The function 
                <me>
                  \phi: \Aut(K/\Q) \to \Perm(\{\a_1, \a_2, \a_3\})
                </me> 
                given by sending <m>\s \in \Aut(K/\Q)</m> to its restriction to the subset <m>\{\a_1, \a_2, \a_3\}</m> is an injective group homomorphism. 
                Thus <m>\Aut(K/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_3</m>. 
                I claim that <m>|\Aut(K/\Q)| = 6</m> and hence <m>\Aut(K/\Q) \cong S_3</m>. 
                I will prove this directly - we will learn of fancier methods to do so later.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                First we notice that the field automorphism of <m>\C</m> given by complex conjugation, namely <m>\C \to \C, z \mapsto \overline{z}</m>, permutes the roots of <m>x^3 - 2</m> and hence it restricts to a field map from <m>K</m> into <m>K</m>. 
                Since this map is <m>\Q</m>-linear and injective (as are all field maps) and <m>K</m> is a finite dimensional <m>\Q</m>-vector space, this map must be onto as well. 
                So, we obtain an element <m>\a \in \Aut(K/\Q)</m> given by <m>\a(z) = \overline{z}</m> for all <m>z \in K</m>. 
                It corresponds <m>(2 \, 3) \in S_3</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Next, we apply <xref ref="cor-porism"/>, which gives <m>\gamma \in \Aut(K/\Q)</m> such that <m>\gamma(\sqrt[3]{2})=e^{2 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}</m>. 
                So, in the numbering above, <m>\gamma</m> corresponds to either <m>(1 \, 2)</m> or <m>(1 \, 2 \, 3)</m> in <m>S_3</m>. 
                We don't really know which of these it is. 
                (In fact, both will occur â the map <m>\gamma</m> is not unique.) 
                But either way we have proven the claim: For notice that both subsets <m>\{ (2 \, 3), (1 \, 2)\}</m> and <m>\{ (2 \, 3), (1 \, 2 \, 3)\}</m> of <m>S_3</m> generated all of <m>S_3</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                In other words, every possible permutation of roots of <m>x^3 - 2</m> arises as a field automorphism of its splitting field over <m>\Q</m>. 
                This is what I meant before when I said that the roots of <m>x^3 - 2</m> are âas symmetric as possible''.
              </p>
            </example>

            <example xml:id="exe-lq-and-x4-2"><title><m>[L:\Q]</m> and <m>(x^4-2)</m></title>
              <p>
                Let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of the irreducible polynomial <m>q(x) = x^4 - 2 \in \Q[x]</m>. 
                So <m>L = \Q(R)</m> where <m>R = \{z_1 = \sqrt[4]{2}, z_2 = i \sqrt[4]{2}, z_3= - \sqrt[4]{2}, z_4 = - i\sqrt[4]{2}\}</m>. 
                By <xref ref="thm-field-aut-action"/>, the action of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> on <m>R</m> is faithful so that we have an injective group homomorphism <m>\Aut(L/\Q) \to \Perm(R)</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Note that this map cannot possibly be onto: there is no <m>\s \in \Aut(L/\Q)</m> such that <m>\s(z_1) = z_2</m>, <m>\s(z_2) = z_1</m>, <m>\s(z_3) = z_3</m>, and <m>\s(z_4) =z_4</m>; 
                i.e., the permutation <m>(1 \, 2)</m> of these roots is not realizable by a field automorphism. 
                To see this note that if <m>\s(z_1) = z_2</m> then <m>\s(z_3) = \s(-z_1) = - \s(z_1) = - z_2 = z_4</m>. 
                So, any field automorphism that interchanges <m>z_1</m> and <m>z_2</m> would have to also interchange <m>z_3</m> and <m>z_4</m>. 
                In fact, as we shall see, <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)| = 8</m>, considerably smaller than <m>4!</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Let us compute <m>[L:\Q]</m>. 
                Note that <m>i \in L</m> since <m>i = z_2/z_1</m> and in fact <m>L = \Q(z_1, i)</m>. 
                In the chain of extensions 
                <me>
                  \Q \subset \Q(z_1) \subset L = \Q(z_1)(i)
                </me> 
                the first one has degree <m>4</m>, since <m>x^4 - 2</m> is irreducible by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/>, and the second has degree at most <m>2</m> since <m>i</m> is a root of <m>x^2 + 1</m>. 
                It would be less than two if <m>x^2+1</m> factors in <m>\Q(z_2)[x]</m>. 
                But since <m>\Q(z_1) \subset \R</m> and <m>L</m> is not contained in <m>\R</m>, the second extension cannot be trivial and so must have degree exactly <m>2</m>. 
                We conclude <m>[L:\Q] = 8</m>. 
                It follows from Proposition  that <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)| \leq 8</m>. 
                (In fact, since <m>L</m> is the splitting field of a separable polynomial, the Theorem below will tell us that <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)| = 8</m>. 
                But we won't appeal to this fact here.)
              </p>
    
              <p>
                We claim <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)| = 8</m> and <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to the subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>S_4</m> generated by <m>(2 \, 4)</m> and <m>(1 \,2 \, 3 \,4)</m>. 
                (This is isomorphic to <m>D_8</m>.)
              </p>
    
              <p>
                The map <m>\C \to \C</m> given by complex conjugation permutes the roots of <m>x^4 - 2</m> and it restricts to an automorphism of <m>L</m> â specially, it fixes <m>z_1, z_3</m> and interchanges <m>z_2</m> and <m>z_4</m>. 
                It follows that complex conjugation determines an element <m>\s \in \Aut(L/\Q)</m> that corresponds to <m>(2 \, 4) \in H \leq S_4</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we get <m>[L: \Q(i)] = 4</m>. 
                Since <m>L = \Q(i)(z_1)</m>, the degree of <m>m_{z_1, \Q(i)}(x)</m> must be <m>4</m>. 
                This shows that <m>x^4 - 2</m> must remain irreducible as a polynomial in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>; 
                this is not obvious, but we have now proven it, and this fact will be useful in what we do next.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                To construct another element of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m>, we use that that <m>L</m> is the splitting field of the polynomial <m>x^4 - 2</m> over <m>\Q(i)</m> and that, as we just showed, <m>x^4 - 2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>. 
                We may thus apply Porism  (also stated in the Corollary) to get that there is an element <m>\tau \in \Aut(L/\Q(i))</m> such that <m>\tau(z_1) = z_2</m>. We may regard <m>\tau</m> as an element of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> since, by definition, <m>\Aut(L/\Q(i))</m> is a subgroup of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m>. 
                We have 
                <me>
                  \tau(z_2) = \tau(i z_1) = \tau(i) \tau(z_1) = i z_2 = z_3
                </me> since <m>\tau(i) = i</m> by construction. 
                A key point here is that if we had merely specified <m>\tau</m> to be an element of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> sending <m>z_1</m> to <m>z_2</m>, then we would have no idea what <m>\tau</m> does to <m>z_2</m> â it was key to define <m>\tau \in \Aut(L/\Q(i))</m> as we did.
                We then also get <m>\tau(z_3) = z_4</m> and <m>\tau(z_4) = z_1</m>. So <m>\tau</m> corresponds to the permutation <m>(1 \,2 \, 3 \,4)</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                We have proven that <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> having order at most <m>8</m> (by the Proposition above) and that it contains <m>(2 \, 4)</m> and <m>(1 \,2 \, 3 \,4)</m>. 
                Since the subgroup generated by these two elements has order <m>8</m>, the claim follows.

                <p>
                  We proceed by induction on <m>[L: F]</m>. 
                  In the base case, <m>[L: F]=1</m>, and thus <m>L=F</m>, so <m>\operatorname{Aut}(L / F)</m> is the trivial group, and both statements hold.

                    \Psi\left(g_{1} H\right)=\Psi\left(g_{2} H\right) \Longleftrightarrow g_{1}(\alpha)=g_{2}(\alpha) \Longleftrightarrow g_{2}^{-1} g_{1}(\alpha)=\alpha
                  </me>
                  which is equivalent to saying that <m>g_{2}^{-1} g_{1}</m> fixes <m>F(\alpha)</m>, and equivalently
                  <me>
                    g_{2}^{-1} g_{1} \in H \Longleftrightarrow g_{1} H=g_{2} H.
                  </me>
                  This proves that the function <m>\Psi</m> is injective.

                  By Theorem <xref provisional="cite"/> <m>, \operatorname{deg}(m)=[F(\alpha): F]</m>. 
                  Thus <m>\Psi</m> is an inclusion of <m>G / H</m> into a set with at most <m>[F(\alpha): F]</m> many elements.

                  Set <m>\alpha=\alpha_{1}</m> and let <m>m</m> be the irreducible factor of <m>f</m> that has <m>\alpha</m> as a root. 
                  Notice <m>m=m_{\alpha, F}</m>. As before, we consider <m>F(\alpha)</m> and set <m>H=\operatorname{Aut}(L / F(\alpha)) \leq \operatorname{Aut}(L / F)=G</m>. 
                  Note that <m>L</m> is also the splitting field of

                    g=\prod_{i=2}^{n}\left(x-\alpha_{i}\right) \in F(\alpha)[x]
                  </me>
                  over <m>F(\alpha)</m>, and <m>g</m> is also separable. 
                  By induction <m>|H|=[L: F(\alpha)]</m>, and it remains to show that
                  <me>
                    [G: H]=[F(\alpha): F]=\operatorname{deg}(m).
                  </me>

                <p>
                  Since <m>f</m> is separable, so is <m>m</m>, so <m>\operatorname{deg}(m)</m> is exactly the number of distinct roots of <m>m</m>. 
                  Showing that <m>[G: H]=\operatorname{deg}(m)</m> amounts to the assertion that the injective map <m>\Psi</m> is also surjective. 
                  This holds since <m>G</m> acts transitively on the roots of <m>m</m>, as shown in <xref ref="thm-field-aut-action"/>.

                Thus it isn't Galois.

                  For each intermediary field <m>E</m>, we know from Corollary 6.31 that <m>L / E</m> is also Galois, and hence it makes sense to write <m>\operatorname{Gal}(L / E)</m>; 
                  moreover, any <m>\sigma \in \operatorname{Gal}(L / E)</m> is an automorphism of <m>L</m> that fixes <m>E</m>, and thus <m>F \subseteq E</m>, so <m>\sigma \in \operatorname{Gal}(L / F)</m>. 
                  This shows that <m>\Psi</m> is well-defined. 
                  Conversely, given a subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>\operatorname{Gal}(L / F), L^{H}</m> is a subfield of <m>L</m> by Exercise 18.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Next, we need to check that <m>\Psi</m> and <m>\Psi^{-1}</m> are indeed inverse functions. 
                  Given a subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>\operatorname{Gal}(L / F)</m>, we have <m>\operatorname{Gal}\left(L / L^{H}\right)=H</m> by Artin's Theorem. 
                  Thus
                  <me>
                    \Psi \circ \Psi^{-1}(H)=\Psi\left(L^{H}\right)=\operatorname{Gal}\left(L / L^{H}\right)=H .
                  </me>
                  Conversely, given an intermediate field <m>E, L / E</m> is Galois by Corollary 6.31, and hence <m>L^{\operatorname{Gal}(L / E)}=E</m> by Corollary 6.24. 
                  Thus
                  <me>
                    \Psi^{-1} \circ \Psi(E)=\Psi(\operatorname{Gal}(L / E))=L^{\operatorname{Gal}(L / E)}=E .
                  </me>
                  This establishes the fact that <m>\Psi</m> is indeed a bijective correspondence.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  Now we check that <m>\Psi</m> satisfies the given list of properties. 
                  For brevity, set <m>G:=\operatorname{Gal}(L / F)</m>.
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        The fact that the correspondence is order reversing follows from the definitions. 
                        Given intermediate fields <m>E_{1} \subseteq E_{2}</m>, any automorphism of <m>L</m> that preserves <m>E_{2}</m> must also preserve <m>E_{1}</m>, thus <m>\operatorname{Gal}\left(L / E_{2}\right) \supseteq \operatorname{Gal}\left(L / E_{1}\right)</m>. 
                        Conversely, if <m>H_{1} \leq H_{2} \leq \operatorname{Gal}(L / E)</m>, then every <m>x \in L</m> that is fixed by every <m>\sigma \in H_{2}</m> must also be fixed in particular by every element of <m>H_{1}</m>, so <m>L^{H_{2}} \supseteq L^{H_{1}}</m>.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        By definition of Galois extension, <m>[L: F]=|G|</m>. 
                        By Artin's Theorem, for any subgroup <m>H \leq G</m> the extension <m>L^{H} \subseteq L</m> is also Galois, and thus by definition <m>\left[L: L^{H}\right]=|H|</m>. 
                        Using the Degree Formula, we have
                        <me>
                          \left[L^{H}: F\right]=\frac{[L: F]}{\left[L: L^{H}\right]}=\frac{|G|}{|H|}=[G: H] .
                        </me>
                        So if <m>H=\Psi(E)=\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)</m>, then <m>L^{H}=E</m> and the formula above can be rewritten as
                        <me>
                          [\operatorname{Gal}(L / F): \operatorname{Gal}(L / E)]=[E: F] .
                        </me>
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Suppose <m>E</m> is an intermediate field that is Galois over <m>F</m>. 
                        Fix <m>\sigma \in G</m> and <m>\alpha \in E</m>. 
                        Since <m>E / F</m> is Galois, by Corollary 6.26 the polynomial <m>m_{\alpha, F}</m> is separable and all of its roots are in <m>E</m>. 
                        By Lemma <m>6.10, \sigma(\alpha)</m> is also a root of <m>m_{\alpha, F}</m>, and thus <m>\sigma(\alpha) \in E</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Suppose <m>\tau \in \operatorname{Gal}(L / E)</m>. 
                        For any <m>\alpha \in E</m> we have <m>\sigma(\alpha) \in E</m>, so <m>\tau(\sigma(\alpha))=\sigma(\alpha)</m>. 
                        Thus
                        <me>
                          \sigma^{-1}\left(\tau(\sigma(\alpha))=\sigma^{-1}(\sigma(\alpha))=\alpha\right).
                        </me>
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        This proves that <m>\sigma^{-1} \tau \sigma \in \operatorname{Gal}(L / E)</m> and hence that <m>\operatorname{Gal}(L / E) \unlhd G</m>. 
                        We have shown that if <m>E</m> is Galois over <m>F</m>, then the corresponding subgroup <m>\operatorname{Gal}(L / E)</m> of <m>G</m> is normal.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        For the converse, consider a normal subgroup <m>N \unlhd G</m> and the corresponding intermediate field <m>E=L^{N}</m>, so that <m>N=\operatorname{Gal}(L / E)</m>. 
                        We will show that <m>E</m> is the splitting field over <m>F</m> of a separable polynomial in <m>F[x]</m>, and hence is Galois over <m>F</m> by Corollary 6.18.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Pick any <m>\alpha \in E</m> and set <m>m:=m_{\alpha, F}</m>. 
                        By Corollary 6.26, <m>m</m> is separable and all of its roots belong to <m>L</m>. 
                        We claim that all the roots must in fact belong to <m>E</m>. 
                        Since <m>m</m> is irreducible and <m>L / F</m> is Galois, by Corollary <m>6.26 G</m> acts transitively on the set of roots of <m>m</m>. 
                        Thus, given be any other root <m>\beta \in L</m> of <m>m</m>, there is a <m>\sigma \in G</m> with <m>\sigma(\alpha)=\beta</m>. 
                        Since <m>N</m> is normal, for any <m>\tau \in N</m> we have <m>\sigma \tau^{\prime}=\tau \sigma</m> for some <m>\tau^{\prime} \in N</m>. 
                        But <m>\tau^{\prime} \in N</m> fixes <m>E</m>, so <m>\tau^{\prime}(\alpha)=\alpha</m>. 
                        Therefore,
                        <me>
                          \beta=\sigma(\alpha)=\sigma \tau^{\prime}(\alpha)=\tau \sigma(\alpha)=\tau(\beta)
                        </me>
                        which shows that <m>\beta</m> is also fixed by <m>N</m>. 
                        But then <m>\beta \in L^{N}=E</m>. 
                        Therefore, <m>E</m> contains all the roots of <m>m_{\alpha, F}</m>, and thus <m>E</m> must contain the splitting field of <m>m_{\alpha, F}</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        We have <m>E=F\left(\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{l}\right)</m> for some <m>\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{l} \in E</m>. 
                        If <m>m_{1}, \ldots, m_{n}</m> are the distinct polynomials among <m>m_{\alpha_{1}, F}, \ldots, m_{\alpha_{l}, F}</m>, then <m>E</m> is the splitting field of the separable polynomial <m>m_{1} \cdots m_{n}</m>. 
                        By Corollary 6.28, <m>E</m> is Galois over <m>F</m>.

                        If <m>E=L^{N}</m> for a normal subgroup <m>N \unlhd \operatorname{Gal}(L / F)</m>, then <m>\operatorname{Gal}(E / F) \cong \operatorname{Gal}(L / F) / N</m>.

                        Let <m>E=L^{N}</m> for a normal subgroup <m>N</m> of <m>G</m>. 
                        We want to show that <m>\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)</m> is isomorphic to <m>G / N</m>.

                      <p>
                        For each <m>\sigma \in G</m>, we claim that <m>\sigma(E) \subseteq E</m>. 
                        By Lemma 6.10, for all <m>\alpha \in E</m> the element <m>\sigma(\alpha)</m> is also a root of <m>m_{\alpha, F}</m>. 
                        But since <m>E / F</m> is Galois, it must contain all of the roots of <m>m_{\alpha, F}</m>, by Corollary 6.26, so <m>\sigma(\alpha) \in E</m>. 
                        Thus <m>\sigma(E) \subseteq E</m>, so the restriction of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>E</m> determines an injective field homomorphism <m>\left.\sigma\right|_{E}: E \rightarrow E</m>. 
                        Since <m>\left.\sigma\right|_{F}=\mathrm{id}_{F}</m>, this map is also a linear transformation of vector spaces over <m>F</m>. 
                        But <m>E</m> is a finite vector space over <m>F</m>, and any injective linear transformation <m>E \rightarrow E</m> must be bijective. 
                        We conclude that <m>\left.\sigma\right|_{E}</m> is an automorphism of <m>E</m>. 
                        We thus have a well-defined function
                        <me>
                          \begin{gathered}

                          \sigma \longmapsto \phi(\sigma)=\left.\sigma\right|_{E} .

                      <p>
                        Moreover, this map is a group homomorphism by construction. 
                        The kernel is the subgroup of <m>G</m> of automorphisms that restrict to the identity on <m>E</m>, which is precisely <m>N</m>. 
                        Hence we have an induced injective group homomorphism
                        <me>
                          \bar{\phi}: G / N \rightarrow \operatorname{Gal}(E / F) .

                        But <m>|N|=|\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)|&lt;\infty</m>, so this map <m>\bar{\phi}</m> must be an isomorphism.

                The intermediate fields are the fixed subfields of <m>L</m> associated to each of these subgroups.

                  <m>E_1</m> has degree <m>4 = [G:H_1]</m> over <m>\Q</m>. 
                  It is clear <m>\a_1</m> (and <m>\a_3</m>) belongs to <m>E_1</m> and since <m>[\Q(\a_1):\Q]=4</m>, we must have <m>E_1 = \Q(\a_1)</m>.

                  If <m>[\Q(\beta):\Q] = 2</m>, then <m>\beta</m> would be fixed by a subgroup of index <m>2</m> that contains <m>(1 \,2)(3 \, 4)</m>, and the only possibility is <m>H_8</m>. 
                  But <m>(1 \, 4)(2 \, 3)</m> sends <m>\beta</m> to <m>\a_4 + \a_3 = - \beta \ne \beta</m>. 
                  So we must have <m>[\Q(\beta):\Q] = 4</m> and hence <m>E_3 = \Q(\beta)</m>.

                  <m>E_6</m> has degree equal to <m>[G:H_6] = 2</m> over <m>\Q</m> and so we merely need to find a single, non-rational element of <m>L</m> fixed by <m>\tau</m>. 
                  Since <m>\tau(i) = i</m> (which can be seen by looking back at how we built <m>\tau</m> originally or by noting that <m>\tau(i) = \tau(\a_2/\a_1) = \a_3/\a_2= i</m>), we get <m>E_6 = \Q(i)</m>.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  I'll skip the details on <m>E_7</m>, but it is <m>E_7 = \Q(\sqrt{2})</m>.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  <m>E_8</m> also has degree two over <m>\Q</m> and so we just need to find a single non-rational element fixed by the two generators of <m>H_8</m>. 
                  Note that <m>\a_1\a_2 = \a_3\a_4 = i \sqrt{2}</m> and so <m>i \sqrt{2}</m> is fixed by both <m>(1 \, 2)(3 \, 4)</m> and <m>(1 \,4)(2 \, 3)</m>. 
                  Thus <m>E_8 = \Q(i \sqrt{2})</m>.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  Finally, we note that <m>G, \{e\}, H_5, H_6, H_7, H_8</m> are normal subgroups of <m>D_8</m>, since <m>H_5</m> is the center of <m>D_8</m> and each of <m>H_6, H_7, H_8</m> has index two. 
                  Some messy checking reveals these to be the only normal subgroups. 
                  It follows from the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftgt"/> that <m>\Q, L, E_5, E_6, E_7, E_8</m> are the only intermediate fields that are Galois over <m>\Q</m>. 
                  As an example, to see directly that <m>E_3</m> is not Galois over <m>\Q</m>, note that <m>(1+i)\sqrt[4]{2}</m> is a root of <m>x^4 + 4</m>, which is irreducible. 
                  But <m>(1-i)\sqrt[4]{2}</m> is also a root of this polynomial and it is not in <m>E_3</m>. 
                  We conclude from Proposition <xref provisional="cite"/> that <m>E_3</m> is not a normal extension of <m>\Q</m>.

              <p>
                The following is an important theorem with many corollaries. In fact, the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, which we will state shortly, will follow from this result.
              </p>
  
              <theorem xml:id="thm-artin"><title>Artin's Theorem</title>
                <idx><h>Artin's theorem</h></idx>
                <statement>
                  <p>
                    Let <m>L</m> be any field. 
                    If <m>G</m> is a finite subgroup of <m>\operatorname{Aut}(L)</m>, then <m>L^{G}</m> is a subfield of <m>L</m>, the extension <m>L / L^{G}</m> is finite and Galois, and <m>\operatorname{Gal}\left(L / L^{G}\right)=G</m>.
                  </p>
                </statement>
              </theorem>
              
              <p>
                Note that we really do mean equality here: both <m>G</m> and <m>\operatorname{Gal}\left(L / L^{G}\right)</m> are subgroups of <m>\operatorname{Aut}(L)</m>, and the theorem states that they coincide. 
                The containment <m>G \subseteq \operatorname{Gal}\left(L / L^{G}\right)</m> is clear: if <m>\sigma \in G</m>, then by construction <m>\sigma</m> fixes every element of <m>L^{G}</m> and hence <m>\sigma \in \operatorname{Gal}\left(L / L^{G}\right)</m>. 
                The point of the theorem is that the extension <m>L^{G} \subseteq L</m> is always Galois and that if <m>\sigma \in \operatorname{Aut}(L)</m> fixes every element of <m>L^{G}</m> then <m>\sigma</m> must belong to <m>G</m>.

                We will not prove <xref text="title" ref="thm-artin"/> right away. 
                Instead, we will first deduce some of its consequences, including the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftgt"/>. 
                We will then illustrate the Fundamental Theorem with many examples and give some consequences of it too. 
                Only then will we circle back to prove <xref text="title" ref="thm-artin"/>.

                    The group <m>G=\left\{\mathrm{id}_{\mathbb{C}}, \sigma\right\}</m>, where <m>\sigma</m> is complex conjugation, is a finite subgroup of <m>\Aut(\mathbb{C})</m>. 
                    <xref text="title" ref="thm-artin"/> tells us that <m>\mathbb{C}^{G} \subseteq \mathbb{C}</m> is finite and Galois with Galois group <m>G</m>. 
                    It follows that <m>\left[\mathbb{C}: \mathbb{C}^{G}\right]=|G|=2</m>. 
                    We already knew all this, since <m>\mathbb{C}^{G}=\mathbb{R}</m>.

                As we head towards the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftgt"/>, we start by stating a few helpful corollaries of <xref text="title" ref="thm-artin"/>. 
                These will also allow us to show that finite Galois extensions are precisely the splitting fields of separable polynomials.

                <proof>
                  <p>
                    Note that <m>F \subseteq L^{\mathrm{Gal}(L / F)}</m> holds by definition, and so
                    <me>
                      [L: F]=\left[L: L^{\operatorname{Gal}(L / F)}\right]\left[L^{\operatorname{Gal}(L / F)}: F\right]

                    by the Degree Formula. 
                    But Artin's Theorem gives

                      \left[L: L^{\operatorname{Gal}(L / F)}\right]=|\operatorname{Gal}(L / F)|

                    and we also know that <m>[L: F]=|\operatorname{Gal}(L / F)|</m>. 
                    Therefore, <m>\left[L^{\mathrm{Gal}(L / F)}: F\right]=1</m> and thus <m>F=L^{\operatorname{Gal}(L / F)}</m>.

                    We know from Example 6.14 that <m>L=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}, i)</m> is Galois over <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> with Galois group <m>D_{8}</m>. 
                    More precisely, this identification is given by writting

                      \alpha_{1}=\sqrt[4]{[2]}, \quad \alpha_{2}=i \sqrt[4]{2}, \quad \alpha_{3}=-\sqrt[4]{2}, \quad \alpha_{4}=-i \sqrt[4]{2}
                    </me>
                    and labelling the four corners of a square with <m>\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{4}</m>, counter-clockwise. 
                    Consider
                    <me>
                      \beta:=\alpha_{1}+\cdots \alpha_{4}

                    Then each of <m>\beta</m> and <m>\gamma</m> are fixed by every Galois automorphism and hence by Corollary <m>6.24 \beta</m> and <m>\gamma</m> must be rational. 
                    In fact, one can easily see that <m>\beta=0</m> and <m>\gamma=2</m>, but notice that the exact same reasoning would apply in general to the sum of roots and the product of roots in the splitting field of any separable polynomial.

              There are many computations you could run on any of these systems (and others), but we will focus on Macaulay2 since it's the most popular computer algebra system among US based commutative algebraists.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Macaulay2, as the name suggests, is a successor of a previous computer algebra system named Macaulay. 
              Macaulay was first developed in 1983 by Dave Bayer and Mike Stillman, and while some still use it today, the system has not been updated since its final release in 2000. 
              In 1993, Daniel Grayson and Mike Stillman released the first version of Macaulay2, and the current stable version of Macaulay2 1.16.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Macaulay2, or M2 for short, is an open-source project, with many contributors writing packages that are then released with the newest Macaulay2 version. 
              Journals like the Journal of Software for Algebra and Geometry publish peer-refereed short articles that describe and explain the functionality of new packages, with the package source code being peer reviewed as well.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              The National Science Foundation has funded Macaulay2 since 1992. 
              Besides funding the project through direct grants, the NSF has also funded several Macaulay2 workshops â conferences where Macaulay2 package developers gather to work on new packages, and to share updates to the Macaulay2 core code and recent packages.

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-mac2-commands"><title>Commands in Macaulay2</title>

            <p>
              A Macaulay2 session often starts with defining some ambient ring we will be doing computations over. 
              Common rings such as the rationals and the integers can be defined using the commands <c>QQ</c> and <c>ZZ</c>; 
              one can easily take quotients or build polynomial rings (in finitely many variables) over these. 
              For example,
            </p>

            <sage language="macaulay2">
              <input>
                R = ZZ/101[x,y]
              </input>
            </sage>
            
            <p>
              and
            </p>

            <sage language="macaulay2">
              <input>
                k = ZZ/101;
                R = k[x,y];
              </input>
            </sage>
  
            <p>
              both store the ring <m>\Z/(101)</m> as <m>R</m>, with the small difference that in the second example Macaulay2 has named the coefficient field <m>k</m>. 
              One quirk that might make a difference later is that if we use the first option and later set <m>k</m> to be the field <m>\Z/(101)</m>, our ring <m>R</m> is not a polynomial ring over <m>k</m>. 
              Also, in the second example we ended each line with a <c>;</c>, which tells Macaulay2 to run the command but not display the result of the computation â which is in this case was simply an assignment, so the result is not relevant.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              We can now do all sorts of computations over our ring <m>R</m>. 
              For example, we can define an ideal in <m>R</m> as follows:
            </p>

            <sage language="macaulay2">
              <input>
                k = ZZ/101;
                R = k[x,y];
                I = ideal(x^2,y^2,x*y)
              </input>
            </sage>
  
            <p>
              Above we have set <m>I</m> to be the ideal in <m>R</m> that is generated by <m>x^2, y^2, xy</m>. 
              The notation <c>ideal( )</c> requires the usage of <c>^</c> for powers and <c>*</c> for products; 
              alternatively, we can define the exact same ideal with the notation <c>ideal" "</c>, as follows:
            </p>

            <sage language="macaulay2">
              <input>
                k = ZZ/101;
                R = k[x,y];
                I = ideal"x2,y2,xy"
              </input>
            </sage>
  
            <p>
              Now we can use this ideal <m>I</m> to either define a quotient ring <m>S=R/I</m> or the <m>R</m>-module <m>M=R/I</m>, as follows:
            </p>

            <sage language="macaulay2">
              <input>
                k = ZZ/101;
                R = k[x,y];
                I = ideal"x2,y2,xy";
                M = R^1/I
                S = R/I
              </input>
            </sage>
  
            <p>
              It's important to note that while <m>R</m> is a ring, <m>R^1</m> is the <m>R</m>-module <m>R</m> â this is a very important difference for Macaulay2, since these two objects have different types. 
              So <m>S</m> defined above is a ring, while <m>M</m> is a module. 
              Notice that Macaulay2 stored the module <m>M</m> as the cokernel of the map 
              <me>R^3\xrightarrow {[x^2\;\;y^2\;\;xy]} R.</me>
            </p>  
  
            <p>
              When you make a new definition in Macaulay2, you might want to pay attention to
              what ring your new object is defined over. For example, now that we defined this ring <m>S</m>,
              Macaulay2 has automatically taken <m>S</m> to be our current ambient ring, and any calculation
              or definition we run next will be considered over <m>S</m> and not <m>R</m>. If you want to return to the
              original ring <m>R</m>, you must first run the command <c>use R</c>
            </p>  
  
            <p>
              If you want to work over a finitely generated algebra over one of the basic rings you
              can define in Macaulay2, and your ring is not a quotient of a polynomial ring, you want
              to rewrite this algebra as a quotient of a polynomial ring. For example, suppose you want
              to work over the second Veronese in <m>2</m> variables over our field <m>k</m> from before, meaning the
              algebra <m>k[x^2, xy, y^2]</m>. We need <m>3</m> algebra generators, which we will call <m>a, b, c,</m> corresponding
              to <m>x^2, x^y,</m> and <m>y^2</m>:
            </p>

            <sage language="macaulay2">
              <input>
                k = ZZ/101;
                R = k[x,y];
                I = ideal"x2,y2,xy";
                M = R^1/I;
                S = R/I;
                U = k[a,b,c]
                f = map(R,U,{x^2,x*y,y^2})
                J = ker f
                T = U/J
              </input>
            </sage>
  
            <p>
              Our ring <m>T</m> at the end is isomorphic to the 2nd Veronese of <m>R</m>, which is the ring we
              wanted. Note the syntax order in <c>map</c>: first target, then source, then a list with the images
              of each algebra generator.
            </p>

            <p>
              As you're learning how to use Macaulay2, you will often find yourself needing some help.
              Luckily, Macaulay2 can help you directly! For example, suppose you know the name of a
              command, but do not remember the syntax to use it. You can ask <c>?command</c>, and Macaulay2
              will show you the different usages of the command you want to know about.
            </p>    

            <sage language="macaulay2">
              <input>
                ?primaryDecomposition
              </input>
            </sage>
  
            <p>
              If instead you'd rather read the complete Macaulay2 documentation on the command
              you are interested in, you can use the <c>viewHelp</c> command, which will open an html page
              with the documentation you asked for. So running
            </p>

            <sage language="macaulay2">
              <input>
                viewHelp "primaryDecomposition"
              </input>
            </sage>
  
            <p>
              will open an html page dedicate to the method primaryDecomposition, which includes
              examples and links to related methods.
            </p>

            <p>
              Many Macaulay2 commands are easy to guess, and named exactly what you would expect
              them to be named. Often, googling âMacaulay2â followed by a few descriptive words will
              easily land you on the documentation for whatever you are trying to do.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Here are some basic commands you will likely use:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <c>ideal (f_1, \dots , f_n)</c> will return the ideal generated by <m>f_1, \dots , f_n</m>. Here products should
                    be indicated by <c>*</c>, and powers with <c>^</c>. If you'd rather not use <c>^</c> (this might be nice if
                    you have lots of powers), you can write <c>ideal (f_1, \dots , f_n)</c> instead.
                  </p>
                </li>
  
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <c>map S, R, (f_1, \dots , f_n)</c> gives a ring map <m>R \to S</m> if <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> are rings, and <m>R</m> is a quotient
                    of <m>k[x_1, \dots , x_n]</m>. The resulting ring map will send <m>x_i \mapsto f_i</m>. There are many variations
                    of <c>map</c> â for example, you can use it to define <m>R</m>-module homomorphisms â but you
                    should carefully input the information in the required format. Try <c>viewHelp</c> map in
                    Macaulay2 for more details.

                <li>
                  <p>
                    <c>ker</c><m>(f)</m> returns the kernel of the map <m>f</m> .

                  <p>
                    <c>I + J</c> and <c>I*J</c> return the sum and product of the ideals <m>I</m> and <m>J</m>, respectively.

            <p>
              As in most programming languages, Macaulay2 follows the convention that the first
              position in a list is the <m>0</m>th position.

              The method <c>primaryDecomposition</c> returns a list of primary ideals whose intersection
              is the input ideal, and <c>associatedPrimes</c> returns the list of associated primes of the given
              ideal or module. Operations on lists are often intuitive. For example, let's say we want to
              find the primary component of an ideal with a particular radical.

              In this case, if we actually want the primary ideal we just selected, as opposed to a

                  Let <m>G</m> be a group and let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m>.

                      <p>
                        Let <m>\varphi: N_G(H)\to\Aut(H)</m> be defined such that <m>\varphi(g)=\psi_g</m>, where <m>\psi_g</m> denotes the inner automorphism (also known as the conjugation automorphism) of <m>H</m> induced by <m>g</m>.
                        Normally this is only well defined when <m>g\in H</m>, but as <m>g\in x\in N_G(H)</m>, we see <m>\psi_x(h)=xhx\inv\in H</m> for all <m>h\in H</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Let <m>x,y\in N_G(H)</m>, <m>h\in H</m> and observe
                        <md>
                          <mrow>\varphi(xy)(h) &amp;= \psi_{xy}(h)</mrow>
                          <mrow>               &amp;= xyh(xy)\inv</mrow>
                          <mrow>               &amp;= xyhy\inv x\inv</mrow>
                          <mrow>               &amp;= \psi_{x}(yhy\inv)</mrow>
                          <mrow>               &amp;= \psi_x\psi_y(h)</mrow>
                        </md>
                        Thus <m>\varphi</m> is operation preserving and a group homomorphism.
                      </p>

                      <p>  
                        Let <m>g\in\ker(\varphi)</m>.
                        Thus <m>\varphi(g)=\psi_g</m> is the identity map on <m>h</m>, meaning <m>ghg\inv=h</m> for all <m>h\in H</m>. 
                        Mulitplying on the right by <m>g</m> yields <m>gh=hg</m>, placing <m>g</m> in <m>C_G(H)</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Now, let <m>g\in C_G(H)</m>. 
                        Thus <m>\psi_g(h) = ghg\inv = gg\inv h = h</m> for every <m>h\in H</m>, meaning <m>\psi_g=\id_H</m> and <m>g\in\ker(\varphi)</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Putting this all together, we see that <m>C_G(H)</m> is precisely the kernel of <m>\varphi</m>, making <m>C_G(H)</m> normal in <m>N_G(H)</m> by <xref ref="thm-norm-iff-ker"> </xref>.

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        From the previous part we know that <m>\varphi</m> is a homomorphism mapping from <m>N_G(H)</m> to <m>\Aut(H)</m> with kernel <m>C_G(H)</m>. 
                        Thus <m>N_G(H)/C_G(H)\cong \im(\varphi)</m> by the <xref ref="thm-fit-group" text="title"/>, making <m>N_G(H)/C_G(H)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>Aut(H)</m>, the group of automorphisms of <m>H</m>.

                        Let <m>G</m> be a non-abelian group of order <m>21</m>.

                        Suppose <m>G/Z(G)</m> is cyclic. 
                        Let <m>x\in G</m> and suppose by way of contradiction that <m>x\not\in Z(G)</m>. 
                        <fn>I don't think this actually needs to be a contradiction proof, but I haven't read it through too carefully and didn't want to break anything by modifying it unneccessarily.</fn>
                        Thus there exists some <m>y\in G</m> such that <m>xy\neq yx</m>. 
                        Note: this means <m>y\not\in Z(G)</m> as well. 
                        As <m>G/Z(G)</m> is cyclic there exists some <m>g\in G</m> such that <m>xN=g^nN</m> and <m>yN=g^mN</m> for <m>n,m\in\N</m>.

                        As coset multiplication is defined as <m>xNyN=(xy)N</m>, this means that <m>xy=yx</m>, a contradiction.

                        Since <m>Z(G)\leq G</m>, <m>|Z(G)|</m> must divide <m>|G|</m> so the options for <m>|Z(G)|</m> are <m>1,3,7,21</m>. 
                        It can't be <m>21</m> because that implies that <m>G</m> is abelian.
                        Consider if <m>|Z(G)|</m> equals <m>3</m> or <m>7</m>. 
                        Then we would have <m>[G:Z(G)]</m> equals <m>7</m> or <m>3</m> respectively. 
                        These are both prime, which implies that <m>G/Z(G)</m> is cyclic and by (a), would mean that <m>G</m> abelian. 
                        So the only option is <m>|Z(G)|=1</m>. 
                        Then <m>21=1+\sum_{i=1}^m[G:C_G(g_i)]\implies \sum_{i=1}^m[G:C_G(g_i)]=20</m>. 
                        Each <m>[G:C_G(g_i)]</m> must be greater than <m>1</m> and divide <m>21</m>.

                  Let <m>p\neq q</m> be two prime integers. 
                  Prove that a group of order <m>p^2q</m> is not simple.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  There are 2 cases, <m>p&lt;q</m> and <m>p&gt;q</m>. 
                  We will show both. 
                  First, when <m>p&lt;q</m>, <m>n_p=1</m> or possibly <m>q</m> if <m>q=pk+1,k\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. 
                  <m>n_q=1</m> or possibly <m>p^2</m> if <m>p^2=ql+1,l\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. 
                  It can't be <m>p</m> since <m>p&lt;q</m> and thus <m>p</m> is not congruent to <m>1 mod q</m>. 
                  When neither, or ONLY one of the possible conditions are met, it forces at least one of <m>n_p</m> or <m>n_q</m> to be <m>1</m> and <m>G</m> wouldn't be simple. 
                  So assume both conditions are met. 
                  <m>n_q=p^2\implies \exists p^2</m> Sylow q-subgroups: <m>H_1,H_2,...,H_{p^2}</m> where <m>|H_i|=q</m> and <m>\forall i\neq j</m> we have <m>H_i\cap H_j=\{e\}</m>. 
                  Then let <m>S=H_1\cup H_2\cup \cdots \cup H_{p^2}\subseteq G</m> and <m>\#S=\underbrace{(q-1)p^2}_\text{elements of order q}+1</m> because <m>S=\{e\}\cup \{\text{elements of order q}\}</m>. 
                  Now <m>n_p=q\implies \exists q</m> Sylow p-subgroups: <m>L_1,L_2,...,L_q</m> where <m>|L_i|=p^2</m> and <m>L_i\cap S=\{e\}</m>. 
                  Note that nothing of order <m>q</m> is in any <m>L_i</m> since <m>q</m> can't divide <m>p^2</m> due to the assumptions <m>(q=pk+1,p^2=ql+1)</m>. 
                  <m>|L_i|=p^2</m> and <m>p^2-1</m> of which not the identity so <m>G</m> has the identity, <m>p^2-1</m> elements of order <m>p^2</m> or order <m>p</m> (which are in <m>L_i</m>) and <m>(q-1)p^2</m> elements of order <m>q</m>(which are in <m>S</m>) which equals <m>1+p^2-1+(q-1)p^2=(1-1)+(p^2-p^2)+qp^2=qp^2</m>. 
                  This means we have all unique elements of <m>G</m> which means that <m>L_1=L_2=\cdots =L_q</m> so <m>L_1\trianglelefteq G</m>. 
                  Thus <m>G</m> is not simple.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Now when <m>p&gt;q</m>,<m>n_q</m> is either <m>1</m> or <m>p</m> or <m>p^2</m> if the necessary conditions are met, but <m>n_p</m> can only be <m>1</m> since <m>p&gt;q</m> and <m>n_p</m> needs to divide <m>q</m> and <m>q</m> is not congruent to <m>1 mod p</m>. 
                  Thus <m>n_p=1\implies G</m> is not simple.

                  Since <m>\mathbb{Z}[x]</m> is abelian, <m>M=\{2f(x)+xg(x)|f,g\in \mathbb{Z}[x]\}</m> which is all polynomials with even constant terms. 
                  This is clearly not equal to the original ring.

                <p>
                  We will show that that the quotient ring is a field which implies that <m>M</m> is maximal. 
                  Define <m>f:\mathbb{Z}[x]\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_2</m> as <m>f(p(x))=f(a_0+\cdots +a_nx^n)=[a_0]_2</m>. 
                  We will show this is an onto homomorphism with kernel equal to <m>(2,x)</m> and thus the two groups are isomorphic. 
                  And since <m>\mathbb{Z}_2</m> is a field, <m>\mathbb{Z}[x]/I</m> is as well. 
                  <md>
                    <mrow>f(p(x)+q(x)) &amp;= f(a_0+\cdots +a_nx^n+b_0+\cdots b_mx^m)</mrow>

                  </md>
                  So <m>f</m> preserves addition.

                  </md>
                  so <m>f</m> preserves multiplication. 
                  Then of course <m>f(0)=[0]_2</m>. 
                  So it maps identity to identity. 
                  Thus <m>f</m> is a homomorphism. 
                  This is clearly onto since <m>0\rightarrow [0]_2</m> and <m>1\rightarrow [1]_2</m>.

                  </md>
                  which by the beginning note is exactly <m>(2,x)</m>. 
                  So the quotient is a field since <m>\mathbb{Z}_2</m> is a field, and thus <m>M</m> is maximal.

                  Let <m>I=\cup_{j\in \mathbb{N}}(I_j)</m>.

                <p>
                  We will show this is an ideal in <m>R</m>. 
                  Let <m>x,y\in I</m>. 
                  Then there exist <m>j,k\in \mathbb{N}</m> such that <m>x\in (I_j)</m> and <m>y\in (I_k)</m>. 
                  Let <m>m=max\{j,k\}</m> because of the ascending chain <m>x,y\in (I_m)</m>. 
                  <m>(I_m)</m> is an ideal so <m>x-y\in (I_m)\subseteq I</m> and for arbitary <m>r\in R</m>, we know <m>rx,ry\in (I_m)\subseteq I</m> and so <m>I</m> is an ideal. 
                  Since <m>R</m> is a PID, there is a <m>z\in R</m> such that <m>I=(z)</m>. 
                  This means that <m>z\in I_n</m> for some <m>n</m>. 
                  This implies that <m>I\subseteq (I_n)\subseteq I</m> so <m>I=I_n</m> and since <m>I</m> was the intersection, all ideals further along in the chain are also contained in it so we get for all <m>t\geq n, I_t=I_n</m>.

                <p>
                  <m>(\implies)</m> Assume <m>M</m> is infinite. 
                  By Thm 1.161 (Mark's notes) CITEX we can turn <m>A</m> into its Smith Normal Form 
                  <me>
                    S=\begin{bmatrix} s_{1,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; 0\\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\ 0 &amp; \cdots  &amp; s_{n,n} \end{bmatrix}
                  </me> 
                  where <m>s_{1,1}|s_{2,2}|\cdots |s_{n,n}</m>, using only elementary row and column operations. 
                  Then CITEX Corollary 1.163 says that <m>M\cong \mathbb{Z}/s_{1,1}\bigoplus \cdots \bigoplus \mathbb{Z}/s_{n,n}\bigoplus \mathbb{Z}^a</m> for some <m>a\geq 0</m>. 
                  Lemma 1.16 CITEX tells us that <m>a=n-n=0</m> so 
                  <me>
                    M\cong \mathbb{Z}/s_{1,1}\bigoplus \cdots \bigoplus \mathbb{Z}/s_{n,n}\bigoplus \mathbb{Z}/1
                  </me>
                  This set is finite in size and equal to <me>\prod_{i=1}^ns_{i,i}</me> unless (at least) one of the <m>s_{i,i}=0</m>. <m>M</m> is infinite so one of them equals 0. 
                  CITEX Smith Normal Form is created by elementary row and column operations so the determinant is preserved (up to sign). 
                  This is because type 1 operations keep the determinant exactly, type 3 flips it to its negative, and type 2 multiplies it by <m>u</m> for some unit <m>u</m> in <m>R</m>. CITEX
                  Here <m>R</m> is <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> and the only units are <m>\pm 1</m> so type 2 also either keep the determinant exactly or just flip to the negative. 
                  And since <m>0=-0</m> and <m>\text{det}(S)=0\implies \text{det}(A)=0</m>
                
                  <m>(\impliedby)</m> 
                  Assume <m>\text{det}(A)=0</m>. 
                  Then in its Smith Normal Form there is a <m>0</m> on the diagonal. 
                  <m>M</m> is presented as above, and one of them is 0, so <m>M</m> is infinite.

                        Let <m>F\subseteq L</m> be a finite field extension. 
                        To show it is algebraic we need to show that every element <m>\alpha \in L</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m> meaning that it is the root of a non-zero polynomial with coefficients in <m>F</m>. 
                        So take <m>\alpha \in L</m>. 
                        Since <m>F(\alpha)</m> is an <m>F</m>-vector subspace of <m>L</m> and <m>[L:F]&lt;\infty</m> it must be that <m>[F(\alpha):F]&lt;\infty</m> and we have shown that if that is finite then <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>. 
                        If <m>[F(\alpha):F]&lt;\infty</m> then the infinite list <m>1,\alpha, \alpha^2,...</m> of elements of <m>F(\alpha)</m> cannot by linearly independent over <m>F</m> so <m>a_0+a_1\alpha +\cdots +a_n\alpha^n=0</m> for some <m>n</m> where not all <m>a_i</m> are 0.

                      <p>
                        We prove the converse is false by a counter-example. 
                        Let <m>E_n=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{2})</m> and set <m>F=\cup_nE_n</m>. 
                        Then <m>F</m> is a subfield of <m>\mathbb{C}</m>. 
                        This is because: <m>E_n\subseteq E_m</m> provided <m>n\vert m</m>, given <m>a,b\in F</m> <m>a\in E_n</m> and <m>b\in E_m</m> for some <m>n,m</m> and hence <m>a,b\in E_{mn}</m>. <m>E_{mn}</m> is a field, <m>a+b,a-b,a\cdot b</m> and provided <m>a\neq 0</m> <m>1/a</m> are all on <m>E_{mn}</m> and hence in <m>F</m>. 
                        So <m>F</m> is a field extension of <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>. 
                        It is algebraic over <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> since each <m>E_n</m> is. 
                        But it is not finite since <m>[E_n:\mathbb{Q}]=n</m> and hence <m>[F:\mathbb{Q}]\geq n</m> for all <m>n</m>.

                <p>
                  By the in particular in proposition 2 in worksheet 22 CITEX, since <m>L</m> is the splitting field over <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> of <m>f</m>, <m>\operatorname{Aut}(L/\mathbb{Q})</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_3</m> since <m>f</m> has degree 3, with only one real root, meaning that it has <m>3</m> distinct roots since complex roots come in pairs. 
                  Furthermore, the 1 real root must be irrational, because otherwise <m>f</m> would be reducible.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  If we order the roots: <m>\{\alpha,\zeta_1,\zeta_2\}</m> where the two <m>\zeta</m>'s are complex conjugates, then the conjugate map(restricted to <m>L</m>) is associated with the permutation <m>(\zeta_1 \zeta_2)</m> or <m>(23)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <m>L</m> is the splitting field of irreducible <m>f</m>, so by CITEX corollary 3 from worksheet 22, the action <m>g\cdot a</m> is transitive, meaning for the root <m>\zeta_1</m>, there exists a <m>g\in \operatorname{Aut}(L/\mathbb{Q})</m> such that <m>g\cdot \alpha=\zeta_1</m>, meaning that <m>g\cdot \zeta_1=\alpha</m> and <m>\zeta_2</m> is fixed (<m>(12)</m>), or <m>g\cdot \zeta_1=\zeta_2</m> and <m>g\cdot \zeta_2=\alpha</m> (<m>(123)</m>). 
                  In either case, we have elements that can generate all of <m>S_3</m> because <m>S_3=\langle (123),(23)\rangle=\langle (12),(23)\rangle</m>.

                  We have <m>[G:K]=[G:H][H:K]=pn</m>, so <m>pn| p!\implies n| (p-1)!</m>. 
                  All of <m>n</m>'s prime factors must be greater than or equal to <m>p</m> since <m>p</m> is the smallest prime that divides <m>|G|</m>. 
                  However since the only factors of <m>(p-1)!</m> are less than <m>p</m> it must be that <m>n=1</m>, so <m>[H:K]=1</m> and <m>K\subseteq H</m> together imply <m>H=K</m>. 
                  So <m>H</m> is the kernel of a homomorphism and thus <xref ref="thm-norm-iff-ker" text="custom"> is normal </xref> in <m>G</m>.

                        Let <m>G</m> be a group of size <m>21</m>. 
                        There is only <m>1</m> Sylow <m>7</m>-subgroup since the number of them has to be congruent to <m>1 mod 7</m> and divide <m>3</m>. 
                        Thus the unique Sylow <m>7</m> subgroup, call it <m>N</m>, is normal. 
                        Letting <m>H</m> be any Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup <xref ref="thm-hk-order" text="custom"> we know </xref> <m>|NH|=\frac{|N||H|}{|N\cap H|}=\frac{7\cdot 3}{1}=21</m>, since the intersection has to be trivial and thus <m>NH=G</m>.
                        By the <xref ref="thm-sdp-recognition" text="title"/> <m>G\cong N\rtimes_{\rho} H</m> for some <m>\rho:H\rightarrow \Aut(N)</m>. 
                        <m>N\cong \mathbb{Z}_7</m> and all automorphisms will be determined by where a generator is sent to. 
                        We need autmorphisms that, when applied 3 times, will return to the identity. 
                        There is the identity automorphism, but then there are only two more. 
                        Those are the automorphisms defined by sending 1 to 2 and by sending 1 to 4. 
                        This is because <m>2^3=8=1mod7</m> and <m>4^3=64=1mod7</m>. 
                        The others don't work because <m>3^3=5^3=6^3=6mod7</m> so there are at most 3 groups of size 21. 
                        (Technically there are just the two from part a, but this question is actually very generous because it doesn't make you prove the conjugacy of the two nontrivial homomorphisms)

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        For invariant factors, we can write <m>G\cong \mathbb{Z}_{n_1}\times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}{n_t}</m> for <m>t\geq 0</m>, <m>n_i\geq 2</m> where each <m>n_{i+1}|n_i</m>. 
                        The exponent will be <m>n_1</m>. 
                        This can be seen because each <m>n_i</m> divides it, and thus for an arbitrary <m>(g_1,g_2,...,g_t)</m> <m>g_1^{n_1}=g_2^{n_1}=g_2^{n_2\cdot k_2}=g_3^{n_1}=g_3^{n_3\cdot k_3}=\cdots =g_t^{n_1}=g_t^{n_t\cdot k_t}=0</m> for integers <m>k_j</m>. 
                        So <m>(g_1,\dots,g_t)^{n_1}=(0,\dots,0)</m>. 
                        So the exponent is less than or equal to <m>n_1</m> since it is the smallest such integer that works. 
                        No integer less than <m>n_1</m> will work though since <m>(1,0,\dots,0)</m> has order <m>n_1</m> so the exponent is both greater than or equal to <m>n_1</m> and less than or equal to <m>n_1</m> so it is therefore <m>n_1</m>.

                      <p>
                        Let <m>p</m> be prime. 
                        <m>\mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}</m> is a finite abelian group so by <xref ref="thm-ftfgag" text="title"/> we can write in its invariant factor form: <m>\mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}\cong \mathbb{Z}_{n_1}\times \mathbb{Z}_{n_2}\times \cdots \mathbb{Z}_{n_t}</m> where <m>t\geq 0</m>, <m>n_i\geq 2\forall i</m> and <m>n_{i+1}|n_i\forall i</m> and this is unique. 
                        We have that in <m>\mathbb{Z}_p</m> for all <m>m&gt;0</m> there are at most <m>m</m> solutions to <m>x^m=1</m>. 
                        From the previous part, we know that the exponent is <m>n_1</m> so there are at most <m>n_1</m> solutions to <m>x^{n_1}=1</m>. 
                        But the definition of exponent tells us that all elements of <m>\mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}</m> satisfy this. 
                        So <m>p-1\leq n_1</m>. 
                        Therefore <m>t</m> must be 1 because we have <m>p-1=n_1\cdot n_2\cdots n_t</m> where each <m>n_i\geq 2</m> which would be a contradiction. 
                        Thus <m>\mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}\cong \mathbb{Z}_{n_1}</m> which is cyclic.

                  Prove that in a principal ideal domain a nonzero ideal is prime if and only if it is maximal.

              <solution>
                <p>
                  <m>(\implies)</m> Let <m>R</m> be a PID and <m>I</m> a prime nonzero ideal. 
                  Let <m>J</m> be an ideal such that <m>I\subseteq J\subseteq R</m>. 
                  We need to show that <m>I=J</m> or <m>J=R</m>. 
                  Since <m>R</m> is a PID, <m>I=(a),J=(b)</m> for some <m>a,b\in R</m>. 
                  There is some <m>r\in R</m> such that <m>a=rb</m> since <m>I\subseteq J</m>. 
                  <m>I</m> is a prime ideal so <m>a=rb\in I\implies b\in I</m> or <m>r\in I</m>.
                </p>
                  
                <p>
                  If <m>b\in I</m> then <m>J\subseteq I</m> because the generator of <m>b</m> is in <m>I</m> and thus all of <m>J</m> is in <m>I</m> and thus they are equal. 
                  If <m>r\in I</m> then <m>r=sa</m> for some <m>s\in R</m>. 
                  Thus <m>a=rb=sab=asb</m> so <m>a-asb=0</m> so <m>a(1-sb)=0</m>. 
                  But this shows that <m>1-sb=0</m> since <m>R</m> is an ID and <m>I</m> is a nonzero ideal, so <m>1=sb</m> and <m>b</m> is a unit and <m>(b)=R</m>. 
                  So <m>I</m> is maximal.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <m>(\impliedby)</m> Let <m>R</m> be a PID and let <m>I</m> be a maximal ideal. 
                  <m>R</m> is a PID so it is commutative. 
                  Thus <m>R/I</m> <xref ref="thm-maximal-iff-field" text = "custom"> is a field </xref> since <m>I</m> is maximal, and thus <m>R/I</m> is an ID. 
                  Now we want to show that <m>I</m> is prime and thus take <m>xy\in I</m>. 
                  We need to show that either <m>x\in I</m> or <m>y\in I</m>. 
                  <m>xy\in I\implies (x+I)(y+I)=0+I</m> and since the quotient ring is an ID this implies that <m>x+I=0+I</m> or <m>y+I=0+I</m> and thus one of them is in <m>I</m>. 
                  So <m>I</m> is prime.

                  Recall that <m>\mathbb{Z}[i]</m> is a ED with norm <m>N(c+di) = c^2+d^2</m>. 
                  Thus, <m>\mathbb{Z}[i]</m> is a PID by <xref ref="thm-ed-is-a-pid"/>.
                  Then there exists <m>a = x+yi \in \mathbb{Z}[i]</m> such that <m>I = (a)</m>.

                  Thus, as <m>qa \in (a) = I</m>, <m>b + I = r + I</m>. 
                  As <m>0</m> is unique, there is one <m>r</m> such that <m>r = 0</m>. 
                  Note as well that there are at most <m>1000N(a)^2</m> (this is quite an overestimate but it works just fine) elements <m>r \in \mathbb{Z}[i]</m> such that <m>N(r) &lt; N(a)</m>.

                  They are not similar.

                  <m>B</m> is already in JCF and <m>B=J_1(2)\oplus J_1(2)\oplus J_2(2)</m> which tells us that the elementary divisors are <m>(x-2),(x-2)</m>, and <m>(x-2)^2</m>. 
                  We can see that the invariant factors of <m>B</m> are <m>(x-2),(x-2)</m>, and <m>(x-2)^2</m>. 
                  Thus <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have different smith normal forms and therefore aren't similar.

                  We just do this because all of our theorems deal with monic polynomials specifically.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  We are assuming <m>f(x)</m> is reducible in <m>L[x]</m>, so <m>f(x)=cp_1(x)\cdots p_n(x)</m> where <m>c</m> is a unit in <m>L</m>, and each <m>p_i</m> has degree <m>0&lt;r_i&lt;d</m> and is itself irreducible in <m>L[x]</m> and monic. 
                  Now let <m>\alpha</m> be a root of <m>p_1(x)</m> and consider <m>L(\alpha)</m>, a field extension of <m>L</m>. 
                  <m>L</m> contains <m>K</m> and <m>\alpha</m> so it is a field extension of <m>K(\alpha)</m> which is itself a field extension of <m>K</m>. 
                  So utilizing the degree formula, we get the following equality: 
                  <me>
                    [L(\alpha):L][L:K]=[L(\alpha):K(\alpha)][K(\alpha):K]
                  </me> 
                  However since <m>\alpha</m> is the root of <m>p_1(x)</m> an irreducible monic polynomial in <m>L[x]</m>, the expression on the left is just <m>r_1\cdot [L:K]</m> since <m>p_1=m_{\alpha,L}(x)</m> and has degree <m>r_1</m>. 
                  The expression on the left is <m>[L(\alpha):K(\alpha)]\cdot d</m> since <m>f</m> has degree <m>d</m> and in our assumption it is irreducible over <m>K[x]</m>. 
                  So we actually have 
                  <me>
                    r_1\cdot [L:K]=[L(\alpha):K(\alpha)]\cdot d
                  </me> 
                  and because <m>\gcd(d,[L:K])=1</m> it must be that <m>d\big\vert r_1</m> a contradiction since <m>0&lt;r_1&lt;d</m>.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a finite <m>p</m>-group for some prime <m>p</m> and <m>N\neq {1}</m> a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>. 
                  Prove that <m>N\cap Z(G)\neq{1}</m>, where <m>Z(G)</m> is the center of <m>G</m>.

              <solution>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a finite <m>p</m>-group for some prime <m>p</m> and <m>N\neq {1}</m> a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  First, we show that the center of <m>G</m> is nontrivial. 
                  Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>Z(G)=\{e\}</m>. We examine the conjugacy classes of <m>G</m>. 
                  From the <xref text="title" ref="thm-class-eq"/>, we know
                  <me>
                    |G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_i^r [G : C_G(g_i)].
                  </me>
                  Note that <m>|G|=p^n</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>, meaning that the only divisors of <m>|G|</m> are powers of <m>p</m>. 
                  In finite groups, each conjugacy class must divide the order of the group by <xref ref="thm-conjugacy-divides-order"/>. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>, <m>[G : C_G(g_i)]=\frac{|G|}{|C_G(g_i)|}=\frac{p^n}{p^m}=p^k</m>, where <m>m,k\in\N</m>. 
                  Since <m>|Z(G)|=1</m>, we see that <m>\sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|\bigg|p^n-1</m>, which is impossible given that <m>p^{n-1} \not\mid p^n</m>. 
                  Thus <m>Z(G)\neq\{e\}</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As <m>N\nsg G</m>, by <xref ref="cor-normal-union-of-conjugacy-classes"/> it is a union of conjugacy classes of the elements it contains, one of which is <m>e</m>. 
                  Assume by way of contradiction that <m>N\cap Z(G)={e}</m>, meaning that <m>e</m> is the only element in <m>N</m> whose conjugacy class is a singleton. 
                  This yields 
                  <me>
                    |N| = 1+ \sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|.
                  </me> 
                  However, by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> <m>N</m> must also be a <m>p-</m>group, and thus by an analogous element counting argument as above we see that there exists some <m>x\in N</m> such that <m>C_G(x)=\{x\}</m>, or that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. 
                  Thankfully, this means that <m>x\in Z(G)</m>, and thus we have <m>Z(G)\cap N\neq 1</m>.

                      <p>
                        Let <m>C_3 = \langle a \rangle</m> be the cyclic group of order <m>3</m>, and let <m>C_9 = \langle b \rangle</m> be the cyclic group of order <m>9</m>. 
                        Let <m>\phi \colon C_9 \to \operatorname{Aut}(C_3)</m> be the homomorphism defined by <m>\phi(b^i)(a) = a^i</m> for <m>0 \le i \le 8</m>, where we identify <m>\operatorname{Aut}(C_3)</m> with <m>C_2</m> via the isomorphism <m>\operatorname{Aut}(C_3) \cong C_2</m> given by sending the non-identity automorphism to the generator of <m>C_2</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Then the semi-direct product <m>G = C_3 \rtimes_{\phi} C_9</m> has order <m>27</m> and is non-abelian. 
                        To see that <m>G</m> is non-abelian, note that <m>bab^{-1} \neq a</m> for any <m>b \in C_9 \setminus {1}</m>, since <m>a</m> has no non-trivial automorphisms.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        To find a presentation of <m>G</m>, we need to identify the generators and relations. 
                        Since <m>C_3</m> and <m>C_9</m> are both cyclic, we can take the generators to be <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> respectively. 
                        Moreover, since <m>C_3</m> is normal in <m>G</m>, we have <m>bab^{-1} = a^i</m> for some <m>i \in {1, 2}</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        To determine the value of <m>i</m>, note that <m>C_9</m> acts on <m>C_3</m> by automorphisms, and the non-identity automorphism of <m>C_3</m> is inversion <m>a \mapsto a^{-1}</m>. 
                        Since <m>bab^{-1} \neq a^{-1}</m>, we must have <m>i = 2</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Therefore, a presentation of <m>G</m> is given by <m>\langle a, b \mid a^3 = b^9 = 1, bab^{-1} = a^2\rangle</m>.

                  Then the kernel of this homomorphism is non-trivial, normal subgroup of <m>G</m> by <xref ref="thm-norm-iff-ker"/>.

                        Let <m>(a+I,b+J)\in R/I\times R/J</m>. 
                        As <m>R=I+J</m>, we can write <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> as <m>a_i+a_j</m> and <m>b_i+b_j</m>. 
                        However, as <m>a_i\in I</m> and <m>b_j\in J</m>, we have <m>(a+I,b+J)=(a_j+I, b_i+J)</m>.

                        However, as <m>b_i\in I</m> and <m>a_j\in J</m>, we see

                <p>
                  Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>n</m> a positive integer. 
                  We say an <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> with entries in <m>F</m> is <em>unipotent</em> if <m>A-In</m> is nilpotent (i.e., <m>(A-In)^k = 0</m> for some <m>k \geq 1</m>). 
                  For the field <m>F = \Q</m>, find (with complete justification) the number of similarity classes of <m>4\times 4</m> unipotent matrices and give an explicit representative for each class.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  Let <m>F=\Q</m>, <m>n</m> a positive integer, and <m>A</m> a unipotent <m>4\times 4</m> matrix with entries in <m>F</m>. 
                  Thus <m>A-I</m> is nilpotent. 
                  Let <m>\l</m> be an eigenvalue of <m>A-I</m>. 
                  Then <m>(A-I)v=\l v</m>, so <m>Av-Iv=\l v</m> and <m>Av=\l v+Iv</m>. 
                  As <m>Iv=v</m>, we have <m>Av=\l v+v</m> and <m>Av=(\l+1)v</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Notice that as <m>\l</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>I</m>, we have <m>\l +1</m> as an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Assume inductively that <m>\l^{n-1}</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)^{n-1}</m>. 
                  Notice 
                  <me>
                    (A+I)^nv=(A+I)(A+I)^{n-1}v=(A+I)\l^{n-1}v=\l^{n-1}(A+I)v=\l^{n-1}\l=\l^n,
                  </me>
                  making <m>\l</m> an eigenvalue of <m>(A+I)^n</m>. 
                  Thus if <m>\l</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A-I</m>, it is an eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)^n</m> as well. 
                  As <m>(A-I)</m> is nilpotent, there exists some <m>k</m> such that <m>(A-I)^k=0</m>. 
                  This means that <m>\l^kv=0</m>. 
                  As <m>v\neq 0</m> and <m>\l^k</m> is a scalar in a field (and hence integral domain) we have <m>\l=0</m>. 
                  Thus the only eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)</m> is <m>0</m>, meaning that the only eigenvalue of <m>A</m> is <m>1</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Eigenvalues of <m>A</m> correspond to the roots of <m>\cp_A(x)</m>, which is a monic quartic polynomial, as <m>A</m> is a <m>4\times 4</m> matrix. 
                  Thus <m>\cp_A(x)=(x-1)^4</m>, as all roots must be <m>1</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Two matrices are similar if and only if they share the same invariant factors. 
                  Given that invariant factors divide <m>\cp_A(x)</m> and each invariant factor must divide the following one, the possible sets of invariant factors for <m>A</m> are the following:

                        We know that <m>L=\Q(\sqrt[5]{11},\z)</m>, as every generator of <m>L</m> can be written using <m>\z</m> and <m>\sqrt[5]{11}.</m>

                        By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/>, we have

                  Let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of <m>x^4-2022</m> over <m>\Q</m>.

                  Let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of <m>f(x)=x^4-2022</m> over <m>\Q</m>. 
                  Let <m>\z</m> be a primitive fourth root of unity. 
                  Thus <m>\z=e^{2\pi i/4}=e^{\pi/2}=\cos(\pi/2)+i\sin(\pi/2)=i</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Notice that the roots of <m>f</m> are the following: 
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        <m>\sqrt[4]{2022} i</m>, 
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        <m>\sqrt[4]{2022}i^2=-\sqrt[4]{2022}</m>, 
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        <m>\sqrt[4]{2022}i^3=-\sqrt[4]{2022}i</m>, and 
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        <m>\sqrt[4]{2022}i^4=\sqrt[4]{2022}</m>. 
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  Thus <m>L=\Q(\sqrt[4]{2022},i)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Using <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> with <m>p=2</m> we see that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>. 
                  Let <m>\a=\sqrt[4]{2022}</m>, and notice that <m>f</m> is the minimum polynomial of <m>\a</m>. 
                  Let <m>K=\Q(\a)</m> and observe <m>[K:\Q]=4</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As <m>i</m> is the root of the monic irreducible polynomial <m>x^2+1</m> we have <m>[L:F]=2</m> and <m>[L:\Q]=[L:F][F:\Q]=2\cdot4=8</m>. 
                  Thus <m>G=\Gal(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> of order <m>8</m>, making it <m>D_8</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Notice that <m>K</m> is an extension of degree <m>24</m>, and thus by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftgt"/> we have a subgroup <m>H\leq G</m> such that <m>H=\Gal(L/K)</m>. 
                  As <m>[L:\Q]=[L:K][K:\Q]</m> we have <m>8=[L:K]\cdot 4</m>, and thus <m>|H|=2</m>. 
                  This makes <m>H</m> the cyclic subgroup of <m>D_8</m> generated by a reflection, the only element of order <m>2</m> in <m>D_8</m>, making it unique. 
                  This is also a normal subgroup of <m>D_8</m>, making <m>K</m> Galois over <m>\Q</m>.

                        Next, suppose there exists a group <m>H</m> and and a homomorphism <m>\varphi : G\to H</m> such that <m>K = \ker(\varphi)</m>. Let <m>g\in G</m> and consider <m>gKg\inv</m>. 
                        Observe 
                        <me>
                          \varphi(gKg\inv)=\varphi(g)\varphi(K)\varphi(g\inv)=0,
                        </me>
                        given that <m>\ker(\varphi)=K</m>. 
                        Thus <m>gKg\inv\subseteq K</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>, making <m>K</m> a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Define <m>\varphi : G \rightarrow SL_2(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})</m>, such that for all  <m>\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b\\ c &amp; d  \end{bmatrix} \in G</m>, 
                        <m>\varphi(\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b\\ c &amp; d  \end{bmatrix}) = \begin{bmatrix} a\mod p &amp; b \mod p\\ c \mod p &amp; d \mod p \end{bmatrix}</m>. 
                        This is easily verifiable to be a well defined function. 
                        To show <m>\varphi</m> is a homomorphism, let  <m>\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b\\ c &amp; d \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} e &amp; f\\ g &amp; h \end{bmatrix} \in G</m>. 
                        Then 
                        <me>
                          \varphi (\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b\\ c &amp; d  \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} e &amp; f\\ g &amp; h \end{bmatrix}) 
                          = \varphi(\begin{bmatrix}ae + bg &amp; af + bh\\ ce + dg &amp; cf +dh  \end{bmatrix}) 
                          = \begin{bmatrix} ae + bg \mod p &amp; af + bh \mod p\\ ce + dg \mod p &amp; cf +dh \mod p  \end{bmatrix}
                        </me> 
                        <me>
                          \varphi(\begin{bmatrix}a &amp; b\\ c &amp; d  \end{bmatrix}) \cdot \varphi(\begin{bmatrix}e &amp; f\\ g &amp; h  \end{bmatrix}) 
                          = \begin{bmatrix} a\mod{p} &amp; b\mod{p}\\ c\mod{p} &amp; d\mod{p} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} e\mod{p} &amp; f \mod{p}\\ g \mod{p} &amp; h \mod{p} \end{bmatrix}
                        </me> 
                        <me>
                          = \begin{bmatrix} ae + bg \mod p &amp; af + bh \mod p\\ ce + dg \mod p &amp; cf +dh \mod p \end{bmatrix}
                        </me> 
                        Thus <m>\varphi</m> is a homomorphism. 
                        Then <m>\ker\varphi = \{A \in G | \varphi(A) = I_2\}</m>. 
                        So for <m>k \in K</m>, we have that <m>\varphi(k) = K \mod p = I_2</m> by definition of <m>K</m>. 
                        So <m>k \in \ker\Phi</m> and <m>K \subset \ker\varphi</m>.
                        Also for <m>A \in \ker\varphi</m> we have <m>\varphi(A) = A \mod p = I_2</m>, so <m>A</m> is congruent to <m>I_2</m> modulo p, and thus <m>A \in K</m>, and <m>K = \ker\varphi</m>. 
                        So we have defined a homomorphism whose kernal is <m>K</m>. 
                        By part (a) we have <m>K</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Let <m>R</m> be a finite integral domain. 
                        Then take <m>r \in R</m> such that <m>r \neq 0</m>. 
                        We'll show that <m>r</m> is a unit which implies it has a multiplicative inverse. 
                        If <m>r = 1</m> then <m>r</m> is a unit and we are done. 
                        Suppose <m>r \neq 1</m>. 
                        Consider set <m>\{r^n | n \in \mathbb{N}\}</m>, which is contained in <m>R</m>. 
                        Since <m>R</m> is finite it follows that this set is finite and there must exists <m>n &lt; m \in \mathbb{N}</m> such that <m>r^n = r^m</m>. 
                        As an integral domain <m>R</m> has the cancellation law so cancelling <m>r^n</m> from the left yields <m>1 = r^{m-n}</m>. 
                        So we have <m>1 = r(r^{m-n-1})</m> and <m>r</m> is a unit. 
                        We can conclude all nonzero elements of <m>R</m> have a multiplicative inverse and <m>R</m> is a field.

                        Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring and <m>P \subset R</m> a prime ideal. 
                        Suppose <m>P</m> has finite index as a subgroup of <m>(R, +)</m>. 
                        Since <m>P</m> is prime it follows by theorem that <m>R/P</m> is an integral domain where <m>R/P = \{r +P | r \in R\}</m>. 
                        By assumption since the index of <m>P</m> in <m>(R, +)</m> is finite there are only finitely many elements in <m>R/P</m>. 
                        By Part <m>a</m>, we have that <m>R/P</m> is a field and again by theorem <m>2.74</m> since <m>R/P</m> is a field, <m>P</m> is a maximal Ideal of <m>R</m>.

                  Let <m>F</m> be a field, <m>V</m> and <m>W</m> finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector spaces, and <m>g : V\to W</m> an <m>F</m>-linear transformation.

                      <p>
                        We form <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> in steps.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Start by picking an ordered basis <m>C' = \{w_1, \dots, w_r\}</m> of the image of <m>g</m>. 
                        For each <m>i</m> pick <m>v_i \in V</m> such that <m>g(v_i) = w_i</m> and set <m>B' = \{v_1, \dots, v_r\}</m>. 
                        Then pick a basis <m>B''</m> of the kernel of <m>g</m>. Let us list the elements of <m>B''</m> as <m>\{v_{r+1}, \dots, v_n\}</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        I claim that <m>B := B' \cup B'' = \{v_1, \dots, v_n\}</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>. 
                        (Note that <m>B' \cap B'' = \emptyset</m> since <m>g(v_i) = w_i \ne 0</m> for all <m>i</m> with <m>1 \leq i \leq r</m> and <m>g(v_i) = 0</m> for all <m>i &gt; r</m>.) 
                        Pick <m>v \in V</m>. 
                        Then, since <m>C'</m> spans the image of <m>g</m>, we have <m>g(v) = \sum_{i=1}^r a_i w_i</m> for some scalars <m>a_i \in F</m>. 
                        It follows that <m>v - \sum_{i=1}^r a_i v_i \in \ker(g)</m> and hence, since the kernel is spanned by <m>B''</m>, we have
                        <me>v - \sum_{i=1}^r a_i v_i = \sum_{i=r+1}^n a_i v_i,</me>
                        for some <m>a_{r+1}, \dots, a_n \in F</m>. 
                        We rearranging this equation, we conclude <m>v \in \Span(B)</m> and thus <m>B</m> spans <m>V</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Now say <m>\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i = 0</m> for some <m>c_i</m>'s in <m>F</m>. 
                        Since <m>g(v_i) = 0</m> for all <m>i &gt; r</m> and <m>g(v_i) = w_i</m> for all <m>i \leq r</m>, this gives that <m>0 = g(0) = g(\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i g(v_i) =\sum_{i=1}^r c_i w_i = 0</m>. 
                        Since <m>C'</m> is linearly independent, we have <m>c_i = 0</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq r</m>. 
                        Going back to the original equation <m>\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i = 0</m>, we see that <m>\sum_{i=1}^r c_i v_i = 0</m> and hence <m>c_i=0</m> for all <m>i</m>, since <m>B''</m> is linearly independent.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Finally we extend <m>C'</m> to an ordered basis <m>C = \{w_1, \dots, w_r, w_{r+1}, \dots, w_m\}</m> of <m>W</m> arbitrarily.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        By our construction, for any <m>v_i \in B</m> we have 
                        <me> 
                          g(v_i) = \begin{cases} w_i &amp; \text{for $1 \leq i \leq r$ and} \\ 0 &amp; \text{for $r+1 \leq i \leq n$} \\\end{cases}
                        </me>
                          and hence 
                        <me>
                          [g]_B^C = \begin{bmatrix} I_r &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}.

                      <p>
                        The existence of such a pair of bases and this matrix tells us that for bases <m>B=\{b_1,...,b_l\}</m> of <m>V</m> and <m>C=\{c_1,...,c_k\}</m> of <m>W</m>, that <m>g(b_i)=c_i</m> for <m>1\leq i\leq r'</m> and <m>g(b_i)=0</m> for each <m>r'&lt;i\leq l</m>. 
                        Rank nullity tells us that <m>\text{dim}(V)=\text{rank}(g)+\text{nullity}(g)</m>. 
                        We will show that the nullity of <m>g</m> is <m>l-r'</m> and therefore <m>r'=rank(g)=r</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        To accomplish this we will show that <m>S=\{b_{r'+1},...,b_l\}</m> for a basis for <m>ker(g)</m> and therefore the nullity of <m>g</m> is <m>l-r'</m>. 
                        To show it is a basis, we need to show that it is linearly independent and that it spans.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <m>S</m> is linearly independent since it is a subset of a linearly independent set. 
                        To show it spans let <m>x\in ker(g)</m>. 
                        <m>x\in V</m> so <m>x</m> can be written as a linear combination of elements in <m>B</m>. 
                        Thus <m>0=g(x)=g(\lambda_1b_1+\cdots +\lambda_lb_l)=\lambda_1g(b_1)+\cdots+\lambda_{r'+1}\underbrace{g(b_{r'+1})}_\text{0}+\cdots +\lambda_l\underbrace{g(b_l)}_\text{0}=\lambda_1c_1+\cdots +\lambda_{r'}c_{r'}</m>. 
                        Those are linearly independent so <m>\lambda_1=\cdots =\lambda_{r'}=0</m> and therefore <m>x</m> was just a linear combination of elements in <m>S</m> so <m>S</m> spans the kernel and is linearly independent. 
                        Therefore <m>S</m> is a basis for the kernel, and we have that <m>\text{nullity}(g)=l-r'</m> so filling in the blanks 
                        <me>
                          \text{dim}(V)=\text{rank}(g)+\text{nullity}(g)

                        is

                        which means that <m>r'=\text{rank}(g)=r</m>.

                <p>
                  Let <m>F</m> be any field.
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two <m>3\times 3</m> matrices with entries in <m>F</m>. 
                        First, suppose that <m>A\sim B</m>. 
                        Matrices are similar if and only if they share the same invariant factors. 
                        As minimum polynomial is an invariant factor and the characteristic polynomial is a product of the invariant factors, we see that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must share the same invariant factors.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Next suppose that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> share the same characteristic polynomial and the same minimal polynomial. 
                        As <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <m>3\times 3</m> matrices, the characteristic polynomial of both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must be a degree <m>3</m> polynomial. 
                        We proceed via cases based on the degree of <m>\mp_{A,B}(x)</m>. 
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              First, suppose <m>\deg\mp_{A,B}(x)=3</m>. 
                              Then <m>\mp_{A,B}(x)=\cp_{A,B}(x)</m>, making <m>\cp_{A,B}(x)</m> the only invariant factor of both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. 
                              Thus <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same invariant factors and are therefore similar. 
                            </p>
                          </li>

                          <li>
                            <p>
                              Next, suppose <m>\deg\mp_{A,B}(x)=2</m>. 
                              As <m>\mp|\cp</m> and the degrees of all invariant factors must sum to the <m>\deg\cp</m>, we know that <m>\cp=\mp\cdot k(x)</m>, where <m>k(x)</m> is a degree <m>1</m> polynomial, which we denote <m>f(x)</m> for <m>A</m> and <m>g(x)</m> for <m>B</m>. 
                              Since <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> share the same minimum and characteristic polynomials, we see <m>\mp\cdot f=\cp</m> and <m>\mp\cdot g=\cp</m>, and thus that <m>f=g</m>. 
                              Hence <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> share the same invariant factors, making <m>A\sim B</m>. 
                            </p>
                          </li>

                          <li>
                            <p>
                              Finally, suppose <m>\deg\mp=1</m>. 
                              The minimum polynomial is the largest invariant factor, and thus the invariant factors of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must be <m>\{\mp,\mp\mp\}</m>, making them similar.
                            </p>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        If we replaced <m>3\times 3</m> with <m>4\times 4</m> then this would allow for <m>\cp_{A,B}(x)=x^4</m> and <m>\mp_{A,B}(x)=x^2</m>, allowing two sets of invariant factors: <m>\{x^2,x^2\}</m> <m>\{x,x,x^2\}</m>. 
                        Notice that <m>C(x)=\begin{bmatrix}0\end{bmatrix}</m> and <m>C(x^2)=\begin{bmatrix}0&amp;0\\1&amp;0\end{bmatrix}</m>. 
                        Set <m>A=C(x^2)\oplus C(x^2)</m> and <m>B=C(x)\oplus C(x)\oplus C(x^2)</m>, so 
                        <me>
                          A=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix} 
                          \text{ and } 
                          B=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}.
                        </me> 
                        These matrices have the same <m>\cp</m> and <m>\mp</m> but are not similar.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Let <m>F=\Q</m>. 
                        We define <m>A=C(x-1)\oplus C(x^2-1)</m> and <m>B=C(x+1)\oplus C(x^2-1)</m>. 
                        Notice that these matrices are in rational canonical form. 
                        However, the invariant factors of <m>A</m> are <m>\{(x+1), (x^2-1)\}</m> and the invariant factors of <m>B</m> are <m>\{(x-1)(x^2-1)\}</m>. 
                        Thus <m>A</m> is not similar to <m>B</m>, but the minimal polynomial of both is <m>x^2-1</m>.

                        </ul>
                        First we examine <m>F=\Q(\sqrt[4]{20})</m>. 
                        Notice that <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^4-20</m>, which is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> using <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> with <m>p=5</m>. 
                        Thus <m>x^4-20</m> is monic and irreducible, making it the minimal polynomial of <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m>. 
                        Thus <m>[F:\Q]=4</m>. 
                        Notice that <m>\a_1+\a_4=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1+i+1-i)=\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, so <m>\sqrt[4]{20}\in E</m>. 
                        Thus there exists <m>\Q\subseteq F\subseteq E</m> such that <m>F \sse \R</m> and <m>[F : \Q] = 4</m>.
                      </p>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Now let <m>K=F(i)</m>. 
                        Notice that <m>i</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^2+1</m>, which is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> as <m>F\subseteq\R</m> and <m>i\not\in\R</m>. 
                        Thus <m>x^2+1</m> is monic and irreducible, making it the minimal polynomial of <m>i</m>. 
                        Thus <m>[K:F]=2</m> and <m>[K:\Q]=8</m> by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Notice that <m>\a_1+\a_4=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1+i+1-i)=\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, so <m>\sqrt[4]{20}\in E</m>. 
                        Thus so is <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{20}}</m>, and so we see that <m>i=\a_1\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{20}}-1</m>, and thus that <m>i\in E</m> as well, making <m>K\subseteq E</m>. 
                        As seen in Part (a), each root can be expressed in terms of <m>i</m> and <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, and so <m>E\subseteq K</m> as well. 
                        Hence <m>K=E</m> and we have <m>[E : \Q]=[K:\Q]=8</m>.

                  Using <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> with <m>p=2</m> we see that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>. 
                  As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible it is the minimum polynomial of <m>\sqrt[3]2\in\Q[x]</m> and <m>[\Q(\sqrt[3]2):\Q]=3</m>. 
                  Thus, by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftgt"/> we know there exists an element of order <m>3</m> in <m>\Gal(F:\Q)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Notice now that <m>f</m> has exactly two complex roots, making complex conjugation correspond to a transposition in <m>S_3</m>. 
                  Thus we have an element of order <m>2</m> and an element of order <m>3</m>, so the order of <m>\Gal(F:\Q)</m> must be at least <m>6</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>.

                <p>
                  As <m>\deg f=3</m> we know <m>\Gal(F:\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_3</m> by <xref ref="thm-field-aut-action"/>, which has order <m>6</m>.

                        Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>f\subseteq F [x]</m> be irreducible. 
                        Thus <m>f</m> is prime, making <m>(f)</m> a prime ideal in <m>F[x]</m> and <m>F[x]/(f)</m> a domain. 
                        Suppose that there existed a proper ideal <m>I</m> such that <m>(f)\subseteq I</m>. 
                        However, as <m>F</m> is a field we know that <m>F[x]</m> is a PID, meaning <m>I=(g)</m> for some <m>g\in F[x]</m>. 
                        If <m>f\in(g)</m> then <m>g|f</m>, meaning that <m>f=g</m>.

                        Thus either both <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> have degree <m>2</m> or one of them has degree <m>1</m>. 
                        As <m>f\neq (x^2+x+1)^2</m>, we see that without loss of generality <m>\deg g=1</m>. 
                        Then <m>g=x</m> or <m>x+1</m>, but neither divide <m>f</m>. 
                        Thus <m>f</m> is irreducible, making <m>F[x]/(f)</m> a field, the elements of which are:

                        <m>H</m> is normal

                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        <m>G/H</m> is abelian.
                      </p>

                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group, <m>H</m> a multiplicatively closed subset of <m>G</m>, and suppose that <m>g^2\in H</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <ol>

                      <p>
                        First, notice that <m>e^2=e\in H</m>. Let <m>x\in H</m>, and consider <m>x\inv</m>. 
                        Notice that <m>(x{\inv})^2=x^{-2}\in H</m>. 
                        As <m>H</m> is multiplicatively closed, we see that <m>xx^{-2}=x\inv\in H</m>. 
                        Thus <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-subgroup-test"/>.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                      <p>
                        Let <m>g\in G</m>, <m>h\in H</m>, and consider <m>gh</m>. 
                        Notice that <m>(gh)^2=ghgh\in H</m>. 
                        Multiplying by <m>h\inv</m> on the right we see <m>ghg\in H</m>, as it is multiplicatively closed and <m>h\inv\in H</m>. 
                        We rewrite <m>ghg=ghggg\inv=ghg\inv g^2</m>, given that elements always commute with their inverses. 
                        As <m>g^2\in H</m>, we see that <m>ghg\inv\in H</m> as well. 
                        Thus <m>H</m> is normal in <m>G</m>.

                        As <m>g^2\in H</m> for every <m>g\in G</m>, every element <m>G/H</m> has order <m>2</m>. 
                        Thus <m>xyxy=e</m> and so <m>xy=(xy)\inv=yx</m>, making the group abelian.

                  Construct a nonabelian group of order <m>21</m> and give a presentation for your group (with justification).

                  First, we know that <m>G=C_{21}</m> is a group of order <m>21</m>. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-cauchy"/>, as <m>3</m> and <m>7</m> are primes dividing the order of <m>G</m> there exist elements <m>k,h</m> of orders <m>3</m>, <m>7</m>, respectively. 
                  Consider <m>K=\langle k\rangle</m> and <m>H=\langle h\rangle</m>, both of which are subgroups of <m>C_{21}</m>. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> we see <m>[C_{21}:H]=3</m>, the smallest prime dividing <m>21</m>, making <m>H</m> normal in <m>G.</m> 
                  Thus <m>HK\leq G</m>, but as <m>K\cap H=\{e\}</m> we have <m>|HK|=21=|G|</m> and thus that <m>HK=G</m>. 
                  By the <xref ref="thm-sdp-recognition"/> we have <m>H\sdp_\rho K\cong G</m>, where <m>\rho:K\to\Aut(H)</m> is the <xref text="title" ref="thm-permrep"/> of the action of <m>K</m> on <m>H</m> via automorphisms given by conjugation in <m>G</m>.

                  Let <m>G</m> be a group, <m>p</m> a prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>, and <m>n_p</m> the number of Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m>.

                      <p>
                        Let <m>G</m> act on <m>\Syl_p(G)</m> by conjugation, inducing the homomorphism <m>\rho: G\to S_{n_p}</m> via the <xref text="title" ref="thm-permrep"/>. 
                        Notice that the order of <m>S_{n_p}</m> is conspicuously <m>n_p!</m>. 
                        The kernel of this map is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m> by <xref ref="thm-norm-iff-ker"/>.
                        Note that since <m>G</m> is simple the only normal subgroups of <m>G</m> are the trivial subgroup and <m>G</m> itself. 
                        However, the kernel cannot be all of <m>G</m> as this would make <m>\rho</m> trivial, which cannot be the case given that our action is transitive by Part (2) of <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>.
                        Thus <m>\ker(\rho)=\{e\}</m>, making <m>\rho</m> injective by <xref ref="thm-inj-surj-ghom"/>.
                        Thus <m>|\im(\rho)|=|G|</m>. CITEX
                        As the image is a subgroup of <m>S_{n_p}</m>, the result follows from <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>.

                        Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> is simple. 
                        <m>1,000,000=10^6=2^6\cdot 5^6</m>. 
                        Thus the number of Sylow-<m>5</m> subgroups is congruent to <m>1\mod 5</m> and divides <m>2^6=64</m>, the options of which are 1 and 16 (See: <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>). 
                        As <m>|G|</m> does not divide <m>16!,</m> this contradicts part (a). 
                        Thus there are no simple groups of order <m>1,000,000</m>.

                  Suppose that <m>T : V\to V</m> is a linear map, where <m>V</m> is a finite dimensional <m>\C</m>-vector space. Fix a polynomial <m>p\in \C[x]</m>.

                        making <m>p(\l)</m> an eigenvalue of <m>p(T)</m>.

                    </li>

                      <p>
                        First note that if <m>T</m> is a scalar of the identity matrix then its only eigenvalue is <m>0</m>. 
                        Let <m>\mu</m> be an eigenvalue of <m>p(T)</m>. 
                        Thus <m>(p(T)-\mu I)v=0</m> for some <m>v</m>. As <m>\C</m> is algebraically closed we can factor the polynomial <m>p(x)-\mu</m> into linear terms: 
                        <me>
                          p(x)-\mu=c(x-r_1)\dots(x-r_n)
                        </me>
                        for roots <m>r_i</m>. 
                        Note that <m>p(r_i)-\mu=0</m> for all <m>r_i</m>. 
                        Observe 
                        <me>
                          \begin{aligned}(p(T)-\mu I)v&amp;=p(T)v-(\mu I)v\\&amp;=c(T-r_nI)\dots(T-r_1I)v\\&amp;=0.\end{aligned}
                        </me>
                        Thus one of these terms must be sent to zero. 
                        Note that if <m>T-r_iI=0</m> for any <m>I</m> this would make <m>T</m> a scaler of the identity matrix. 
                        Thus there exists some <m>i</m> such that <m>(T-r_iI)v=0</m>, making <m>r_i</m> an eigenvalue of <m>T</m>. 
                        Notice that as <m>p(r_i)-\mu=0</m> we have <m>p(r_i)=\mu</m>, completing the proof.

                      <p>
                        Let <m>T:V \to V</m> be the linear operator given by <m>T(p) = xp'</m> (where <m>p'</m> denotes the derivative of <m>p</m>). 
                        Note that the change of basis matrix for this operator is given by 
                        <me>
                          \begin{bmatrix}
                            0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                            0 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                            \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
                            0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; n-1 \\

                        with the basis <m>\{1,x,\dots,x^{n-1}\}</m>. 
                        Thus <m>\cp_A(x)</m> will be given by the determinant of the matrix
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <me>
                          \begin{bmatrix}
                            x &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                            0 &amp; x-1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                            \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
                            0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; x-(n-1) \\

                        </me>
                        which is diagonal. 
                        Hence 
                        <me>
                          \cp_AT(x)=\displaystyle\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(x-i).
                        </me>
                        Thus <m>\cp_AT(x)</m> factors into distinct linear polynomials, each of which is in the form <m>(x-i)</m> for <m>0\leq i\leq n-1</m>. 
                        Thus each linear term is an elementary divisor, making each Jordan block a <m>1\times1</m> matrix with <m>i</m> as the only entry. 
                        Thus the Jordan Canonical form is

                      <p>
                        This time around the change of basis matrix (denoted <m>B</m> and using the same basis as above) for this matrix has <m>0</m>s along the diagonal, and increasing natural numbers (starting at <m>0</m>, sorry) along the upper diagonal. 
                        Thus <m>\cp_B(x)=x^n</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Recall that the minimal polynomial corresponding to <m>B</m> will be the the smallest monic polynomial such that <m>B</m> is sent to 0. 
                        Note that as <m>D</m> is the operator sending <m>p</m> to its derivative, and that <m>D^{(2)}=D(D(p))=p''=p^{(2)}</m>. 
                        Thus <m>B^2</m> can be viewed as a change of basis matrix for taking the second derivative of the basis, and so on.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        As the basis extends to <m>x^{n-1}</m>, it requires <m>n</m> derivatives to make this polynomial become <m>0</m>. 
                        Thus the minimal polynomial of <m>B</m> must be <m>x^n</m>, as it it monic and <m>B^n=0</m>. 
                        As the degree of the invariant factors must sum to <m>n</m> and <m>\mp_B(x)=x^n</m>, which is itself an invariant factor, we see that it must in fact be the only one.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        As <m>x^n</m> is already a power of a prime, it is the only elementary divisor as well. 
                        Thus the Jordan Canonical Form for <m>B</m> is an <m>n\times n</m> Jordan Block with <m>0</m>s along the diagonal and <m>1</m>s along the sub-diagonal.

                  making <m>\a</m> a primitive sixth root of unity. 
                  By squaring primitive sixth roots of unity over and over we get all of the other sixth roots of unity as well, and so <m>e^{2\pi i/6}\in L</m>.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G = A_7</m> and <m>S</m> be the set of elements of <m>G</m> of order <m>7</m>. 
                  Prove that <m>S</m> is not a conjugacy class of <m>G</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  Elements of order <m>7</m> in <m>G</m> must permute all <m>7</m> elements, making them of the form <m>(abcdefg)</m>. 
                  There are <m>6!</m> such permutations, given that we can always reorder them so that <m>a</m> is first, leaving <m>6</m> remaining spots without replacement. 
                  Let <m>S</m> denote the set of these <m>6!</m> elements.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Suppose by way of contradiction there existed some <m>s\in G</m> such that <m>S=C_s(G)</m>. 
                  Let <m>G</m> act on itself through conjugation, making <m>S=C_s(G)=\Orb(s)</m> by the definition of conjugacy class. 
                  The <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/> tells us that <m>|G|=|\Orb(s)|\cdot|\Stab(s)|</m>, meaning that the order of <m>S</m> must divide the order of <m>G</m>.
                  However, <m>|G|=\frac{7!}{2}</m> and <m>|S|=6!</m>, so this is a contradiction. 
                  Thus <m>S</m> is not a conjugacy class of <m>G</m>.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group acting transitively on a set <m>S</m>. For <m>a\in S</m>, let <m>G_a = \{g\in G | ga = a\}</m> be the stabilizer of <m>a</m> under the action from <m>G</m>.
                </p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Let <m>a, b\in S</m>. 
                      Prove there exists <m>g\in G</m> such that <m>G_b = gG_ag\inv</m>.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Suppose <m>S</m> has more than one element and that <m>G</m> is finite. 
                      Prove that there exists <m>g\in G</m> which has no fixed point, that is, for all <m>a\in S, ga\neq a</m>
                    </li>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group acting transitively on a set <m>S</m>.
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        The action is transitive, so there exists some <m>g\in G</m> such that <m>ga=b</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Let <m>x\in\Stab(a)</m>, consider <m>gxg\inv b</m>. 
                        Since <m>g\inv b=a</m>, we have <m>gxa</m>, <m>x</m> stabilizes <m>a</m> so now <m>ga</m>, but <m>ga=b</m>. 
                        So <m>g\Stab(a)g\inv\subseteq\Stab(b)</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Let <m>x\in\Stab(b)</m>. 
                        We know <m>xb=b</m> and also <m>ga=b</m>, and so <m>xga=ga</m>. 
                        Applying <m>g\inv</m> to both to see <m>g\inv xga=a</m>. 
                        This puts <m>g\inv xg\in\Stab(a)</m>. 
                        Thus <m>x\in g\Stab(a)g\inv</m>, completing the proof.

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        The action is transitive, so there is only one orbit, and so <m>\Orb(a)=\Orb(b)=G</m>. 
                        Since <m>G</m> is finite, the <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/> tells us <m>|\Orb(a)|=|G|/|\Stab(a)|</m>. 
                        Since every orbit has the same order as <m>G</m>, we see <m>\Stab(a)=\{e\}</m> for all <m>a\in S</m>. 
                        Thus there cannot exist any fixed points.

            <activity><title>Problem 3</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>175 = 3^2\cdot 5^2</m> and suppose <m>G</m> contains an element of order <m>25</m>. 
                  Prove that <m>G</m> is abelian.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  First, note that <m>3^2\cdot 5^2=225</m>, not <m>175</m>. 
                  You hate to see it. 
                  Anyway, let <m>x</m> be an element of order <m>25</m> and consider <m>H=\langle x\rangle</m>, a cyclic subgroup of order <m>25</m>. 
                  The possible number of Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m> is exactly <m>1</m>, making <m>H</m> this subgroup and thus normal in <m>G</m>. 
                  Let <m>K</m> be a Sylow <m>3</m> subgroup, it intersects <m>H</m> trivially and thus <m>G\cong H\sdp_{\rho}K</m>, where <m>\rho:K\to\Aut(H)</m>. 
                  The order of <m>\Aut(H)</m> is <m>20</m>, which is relatively prime to <m>|K|</m>, making <m>\rho</m> trivial and <m>G=H\times K</m> and thus abelian.

                <p>
                  Let <m>R</m> be an integral domain and let <m>M</m> be an <m>R</m>-module. 
                  Recall that a subset <m>S</m> of <m>M</m> is <em>linearly independent</em> if whenever <m>â_i r_is_i = 0</m> for ring elements <m>r_i</m> and elements <m>s_i â S</m>, we must have <m>r_i = 0</m> for all <m>i</m>. 
                  We say <m>S</m> is <em>maximally linearly independent</em> if it is linearly independent and it is not properly contained in a linear independent subset of <m>M</m>. 
                  Finally, recall that we say an <m>R</m>-module <m>P</m> is torsion if for all <m>p \in P , rp = 0</m> for some non-zero <m>r\in R</m>.
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Suppose <m>S</m> is a linearly independent subset of <m>M</m> and let <m>N</m> be the submodule of <m>M</m> generated by <m>S</m>. 
                      Prove it is maximally linearly independent if and only if <m>M/N</m> is torsion.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Prove that if for every module <m>M</m> every maximally independent subset of <m>M</m> generates <m>M</m> as an <m>R</m>-module, then <m>R</m> must be a field.

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Suppose <m>S</m> is a linearly independent set <m>S\subseteq M</m> and let <m>N=\text{span}(S)</m>.
                        <m>(\implies)</m> Assume <m>S</m> is maximal linearly independent. 
                        To show <m>M/N</m> is torsion we need to show for an arbitrary <m>m+n\in M/N</m> that there exists <m>r\neq 0\in R</m> such that <m>r(m+N)=0+N</m>. 
                        We will skip <m>0+N</m> since this is true for all <m>r\in R</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Let <m>m+N\in M/N</m> such that <m>m+N\neq 0+N</m>. 
                        This means that <m>m\not \in N=\text{span}(S)</m> so <m>m\not \in S</m>. <m>S</m> is maximal linearly independent so <m>S\cup \{m\}</m> is linearly dependent. 
                        Therefore there exists 
                        <me>
                          \sum_{i=1}^nr_is_i=0,r_i\in R,s_i\in S\cup \{m\}
                        </me> where not all <m>r_i=0</m>. 
                        Note that <m>m</m> must be in this sum (and its coefficient can't be 0), since if it isn't, it breaks the linear independence of <m>S</m>. 
                        We will rearrange so that <m>m</m> is first and we get 
                        <me>
                          r_1m+\sum_{i=2}^nr_is_i=0\implies \sum_{i=2}^nr_is_i=-r_1m
                        </me> 
                        so <m>-r_1m\in \text{span}(S)=N</m>. 
                        Since <m>r_1\in R, -r_1\in R</m> and <m>r_1\neq 0,-r_1\neq 0</m>. 
                        For this <m>-r_1, -r_1(m+N)=-r_1m+N=0+N</m>. So <m>M/N</m> is torsion.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <m>(\impliedby)</m> Assume <m>M/N</m> is torsion. 
                        To show <m>S</m> is maximal linearly independent we just need to show for any <m>T</m> such that <m>S\subsetneq T\subseteq M</m> that <m>T</m> is linearly dependent. 
                        Let <m>T</m> be such a set, thus there exists <m>t\in T\setminus S</m>. 
                        Consider <m>(t+N)</m>. <m>M/N</m> is torsion so there exists <m>r\neq 0\in R</m> such that <m>r(t+N)=(rt+N)=0+n\implies rt\in N=\text{span}(S)</m>. 
                        Thus 
                        <me>
                          rs=\sum_{i=1}^nr_is_i,r_i\in R,s_i\in S
                        </me> 
                        and <m>S\subsetneq T</m> so each <m>s_i\in T</m> and 
                        <me>
                          \sum_{i=1}^nr_is_i-rs=0
                        </me> 
                        with not all 0 coefficients so <m>T</m> is linearly dependent. 
                        Note that this works when <m>t</m> is already in the span of <m>S</m>, the <m>r</m> just equals <m>1</m>. 
                        Finally we find that <m>S</m> is maximal.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Assume for every <m>R</m>-module <m>M</m> that each maximal linearly independent subset <m>S</m> generates <m>M</m>. 
                        By HW2 for <m>R</m> commutative and <m>0\neq 1</m> (which we have since <m>R</m> is an integral domain), if every <m>R</m>-module is free, then <m>R</m> is a field. 
                        For every <m>M</m> to be free we need it to have a linearly independent basis, which these assumptions imply for all modules with a maximal linearly independent subset. 
                        Since if one such <m>S</m> exists, then <m>M=\text{span}(S)</m> and <m>S</m> is linearly independent, <m>M</m> is free. 
                        So we just need to show every <m>R</m>-module <m>M</m> has a maximal linearly independent subset.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        To show every module has a maximal linearly independent subset we use Zorn's lemma.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Let <m>P</m> be a collection of linearly independent subsets of <m>M</m>. 
                        <m>P</m> is nonempty since <m>\emptyset</m> is linearly independent. 
                        Let <m>B</m> be a totally ordered subset of <m>P</m>. 
                        If <m>P</m> is empty then <m>B</m> is bounded above by <m>\emptyset</m>. 
                        So assume <m>B</m> is nonempty. 
                        We will show that <me>I=\bigcup_{J\in B}J</me> is linearly independent and this clearly bounds <m>B</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        To show that <m>I</m> is linearly independent take an arbitrary linear combination of elements in <m>I</m> that equals 0.
                        <me>
                          \sum_{i=1}^nr_ib_i
                        </me> 
                        Each <m>b_i</m> is in <m>J_i</m> for some <m>J_i\in B</m> and there is a finite amount of them so there is one <m>J_i</m> that contains all of the others. 
                        Since <m>M</m> is abelian we can arrange these in any order so we will arrange them so that <m>J_1\subseteq J_2\subseteq \cdots \subseteq J_n</m>. 
                        (These could all be the same, but we don't care.) 
                        Since all of the <m>b_i</m> must be in <m>J_n</m> and <m>J_n</m> is linearly independent, we must have that <m>r_i=0</m> for each <m>i</m> and thus <m>I</m> is linearly independent so <m>B</m> is bounded above by an element in <m>P</m>. 
                        Thus we can apply Zorn's lemma <m>P</m> has some maximal element.
                      </p>

                        (just to clarify) Every <m>M</m> has a maximal linearly independent subset, <m>S</m>, as an <m>R</m>-module. 
                        For this <m>R</m>, this <m>S</m> generates <m>M</m> so <m>M</m> is free. 
                        So under this <m>R</m> every module is free, and by HW2 since <m>R</m> commutative with <m>1\neq 0</m> (because it is an integral domain), <m>R</m> is a field.

                  Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with <m>1\neq 0</m> and let <m>f : R^m\to R^n</m> be a surjective <m>R</m>-module homomorphism, with <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> integers. 
                  Prove <m>m \geq n</m>.

                  Let <m>R^n=N</m> and <m>R^m=M</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let <m>I</m> be a maximal ideal in <m>R</m>. 
                  Thus <m>R/I</m> is a field. 
                  Lemma tells us that <m>M/IM</m> and <m>N/IN</m> are <m>R/I</m>-vector spaces. 
                  Additionally, this gives rise to <m>\overline{p}:M/IM\to N/IN</m>, which is a surjective <m>R/I</m>-module linear transformation.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Note that <m>M</m> is generated by <m>e_i+IM</m> for <m>i\leq m</m>. 
                  Let <m>a_i\in R</m> and consider <m>\sum a_ie_i=0</m>. 
                  For this to be <m>0</m> we need it to be in <m>IM</m>, and thus all <m>a_i\in I</m>. 
                  So the set of <m>e_i</m> is a basis for <m>M/IM</m> with <m>m</m> elements. 
                  Likewise <m>N/IN</m> has a basis with <m>n</m> elements. 
                  As we are surjective, Rank <m>=n</m>, <m>\dim=m</m>. 
                  So by 
                  Rank-Nullity CITEX
                  <m>\dim(\ker)=m-n</m> which is only positive with <m>m\geq n</m>.

                  Let <m>f (x) = x^p-5 \in \Q[x]</m> where <m>p</m> is an odd prime, and let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of <m>f (x)</m> over <m>\Q</m>. 
                  Using <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> 
                  with <m>p=5</m> we see that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>. Notice that <m>\sqrt[p]5</m> is a root of this polynomial. As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible it is the minimum polynomial of <m>\sqrt[p]5</m>, and thus <m>[\Q(\sqrt[p]5):\Q]=p</m>. Let <m>\z</m> be a primitive <m>p\th</m> root of unity. Notice that <m>\z</m> is a root of the <m>(p-1)\th</m> cyclotomic polynomial, <m>g(x)</m>, which is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by the Gospel of Mark.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>g</m>, there exists a root <m>\a</m> of <m>g\in L</m>. 
                  Consider <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a)</m>. As <m>\a</m> is algebraic in <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a)</m> we know there exists some unique irreducible minimal polynomial <m>h</m> of degree <m>q</m>, and thus that <m>[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q(\sqrt[p]5)]=q</m>. 
                  By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we see 
                  <me>
                    [\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q]=[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q[\sqrt[p]5][\Q(\sqrt[p]5:\Q]=pq.
                  </me>
                  However, <m>[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q]=[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q(\a)][\Q(\a):\Q]</m> and so <m>pq=(p-1)m</m> for some <m>m\in\Z</m>, so <m>(p-1)|pq</m>. 
                  As <m>\gcd((p-1),p)=1</m> we must have <m>(p-1)|q</m>. 
                  But <m>q</m> was defined to be the degree of <m>h</m>, which divides <m>g</m>. 
                  As <m>(p-1)|q</m> and <m>q\leq (p-1)</m>, we see that <m>(p-1)=q</m>, so <m>g=kh</m> for some <m>k\in \Q</m>. 
                  As irreducible polynomials multiplied by a constant are still irreducible, we see that <m>g</m> is indeed irreducible in <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]5)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As <m>g</m> is monic and irreducible in <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]5)</m> we see that it is the minimum polynomial of <m>\z</m>, and thus <m>[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q(\sqrt[p]5)]=(p-1)</m>. 
                  As <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a)=L</m>, we have <m>[L:\Q]=p(p-1)</m>.

Let <m>X</m> be a totally ordered subset of <m>A</m>, and let <m>B</m> be the union of all the elements in <m>X</m>. Unions of subspaces are subspaces, and by

                        we see that <m>B\cap W=\{0\}</m>. 
                        Thus by

                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>2m</m> for some odd integer <m>m &gt; 1</m>.

                        Let <m>g,h\in G</m>. 
                        Two functions <m>\lambda_g,\lambda_h</m> are equal iff they agree at all inputs, so let <m>a\in G</m>. 
                        <m>(f(g)f(h))(a)=f(g)\circ f(h)(a)=f(g)(\lambda_h(a))=f(g)(ha)=\lambda_g(ha)=gha=\lambda_{gh}(a)=f(gh)(a)</m> so it is a homomorhpism.

                      <p>
                        To show it is injective consider <m>ker(f)</m>. 
                        Suppose <m>g\in ker(f)</m>, then <m>f(g)=id_G</m> so <m>f(g)(a)=a</m> for all <m>a\in G</m>. <m>f(g)(a)=\lambda_g(a)=ga=a</m> for all <m>a\in A</m>. 
                        This implies

                          \begin{aligned} ga&amp;=a\nonumber\\ gaa^{-1}&amp;=aa^{-1}\nonumber\\ g&amp;=e\nonumber \end{aligned}
                        </me> 
                        so the kernel is trivial <m>\iff</m> <m>f</m> is injective.

                        Let <m>g\in G</m> such that <m>|g|=2\implies g^2=e</m>. 
                        Since <m>f</m> is a hom, we know <m>g^2=e\implies f(g^2)=f(g)^2=id_G</m> so its order is 2 as well. 
                        In a permuation group, elements of order 2 are products of transpositions. 
                        As <m>g\neq e</m> there are no fixed points so all <m>2m</m> points are moved and thus <m>\lambda_g</m> is the product of an odd number (<m>m</m>) of transpositions.

                        By Cauchy's, CITEX there is an element of order 2 in <m>G</m> so <m>f(G)</m> which is a subgroup of <m>Perm(G)</m> lies exactly half within <m>A_{2m}</m> and half outside of it. 
                        So <m>f^{-1}(A_{2m})</m> which is a subgroup by properties of homomorhpisms, is half of <m>G</m> and thus has index 2. 
                        Therefore <m>G</m> is not simple.

                        We proceed via the contrapositive.

                        Note that <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> both have <m>p^k</m> elements, where <m>p^k</m> is the largest power of <m>p</m> that divides the order of <m>G</m>. 
                        Recall <m>|PQ|=\frac{|P||Q|}{|P\cap Q|}=\frac{p^{2k}}{|P\cap Q|}</m>. 
                        As <m>p^k</m> is the largest power of <m>p</m> that divides the order of <m>G</m>, we see that <m>|P\cap Q|</m> must be at least <m>p^k</m>.

                        As <m>xPx\inv</m> is a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup that is contained in <m>N_G(P)</m>, we see that <m>xPx\inv=P</m>, placing <m>x\in N_G(P)</m>.

                        As <m>I</m> and <m>J</m> are both ideals, each term in this sum is contained both in <m>I</m> and <m>J</m>. 
                        Thus, by absorption, <m>x\in I\cap J</m>.

                        However, as <m>b_i\in I</m> and <m>a_j\in J</m>, we see

                        Thus <m>f</m> is a surjective homomorphism.

                        As <m>R^m\cong R^n</m>, we can tensor both sides to see <m>R^m\tensor I\cong R^n\tensor I</m>, and so <m>R^m/IR^m\cong R^n/IR^n</m>. 
                        As both of these are finitely dimensional vector spaces, they must have the same rank, and thus <m>m=n</m>.

                  Find all the ideals of <m>\Z[x]</m> that contain <m>(6, x^2 + x + 1)</m>, the ideal of <m>\Z[x]</m> generated by <m>6</m> and <m>x^2 + x + 1</m>.

                  First, notice that <m>x^2+x+1</m> is irreducible in <m>\Z[x]</m> as it is a cyclotomic polynomial. 
                  Thus the possibilities are the following: 
                  - <m>I=(3,x^2+x+1)</m>, 
                  - <m>J=(2,x^2+x+1)</m>, 
                  - <m>L=(6,x^2+x+1)</m>, 
                  - <m>\Z[x]</m>. 
                  Notice that <m>\Z[x]=(1)</m>, which is neither prime nor maximal, as those ideals must be proper. 
                  The ideal <m>L</m> is not maximal as it is contained in both <m>I</m> and <m>J</m>, nor is it prime, given that <m>3\cdot2\in L</m> but neither <m>3</m> nor <m>2</m> are in <m>L</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Both <m>I</m> and <m>J</m> are generated with irreducible elements, making them irreducible ideals and thus maximal.

            <activity><title>Problem 7</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Suppose <m>F</m> is any field. 
                  Recall that a square matrix <m>A</m> with entries in <m>F</m> is nilpotent if <m>A^j = 0</m> for some positive integer j.
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Prove that if <m>A\in Mat_{n\times n}(F)</m> and <m>A</m> is nilpotent, then <m>A^n = 0</m>.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Find, with justification, the number of similarity classes of <m>5 \times 5</m> nilpotent matrices with entries in <m>F</m>.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  Let <m>F</m> be a field.
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Assume <m>A\in \text{Mat}_{n\times n}(F)</m> is nilpotent. 
                        Thus there exists a positive integer <m>l</m> such that <m>A^l=0</m>. 
                        Thus the set of positive integers <m>S=\{z\in \mathbb{Z}|A^z=0\}</m> is nonempty, so by the well-ordering-principle we can choose a smallest element of <m>S</m>, call it <m>m</m>. 
                        hus <m>A^m=0</m> and for each positive integer <m>p&lt;m</m> we have <m>A^p\neq 0</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Thus we have two cases (1) <m>m\leq n</m> and (2) <m>n&lt;m</m>. 
                        Case (1) is straightforward. 
                        If <m>m\leq n</m>, then <m>n-m\geq 0</m> and we can consider
                        <me>
                          \begin{aligned}
                          A^m=0\nonumber\\
                          A^{n-m}A^m=A^{n-m}(0)=0\nonumber\\
                          A^n=0\nonumber
                          \end{aligned}
                        </me>
                      </p>

                      <p>              
                        For case (2): Observe that <m>p(x)=x^m\in F[x]</m> is in <m>I=\{q(x)|q(A)=0\}</m> the ideal generated by the minimal polynomial of <m>A</m>, <m>\text{MinPoly}_A(x)</m>. 
                        This tells us that <m>\text{MinPoly}_A(x)\vert x^m\implies \text{MinPoly}_A(x)=x^k</m> for some <m>1\leq k\leq m</m> since these are the only monic divisors of <m>x^m</m>. 
                        Next we know that <m>\deg(\text{CharPoly}_A(x))=n</m> and also that <m>\text{CharPoly}_A(x)\in I</m> by Cayley-Hamilton. 
                        So <m>\text{MinPoly}_A(x)\vert \text{CharPoly}_A(x)</m> and therefore degree of the minimal polynomial is lesser than or equal to <m>n</m>. 
                        Which gives us the following inequality <me>1\leq k\leq n&lt;m</me> and since <m>\text{MinPoly}_A(A)=0</m> this is a contradiction since <m>m</m> is the smallest. 
                        So the second case is not possible, and therefore <m>m\leq n</m> and by case 1 <m>A^n=0</m>.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Let <m>A</m> be a nilpotent <m>5\times 5</m> matrix. 
                        There exists some <m>m\in\N</m> such that <m>A^m=0</m>. 
                        Let <m>\lambda</m> be an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>, and so <m>\lambda^m</m> is an eigenvalue for <m>A^m=0</m>. 
                        As <m>F</m> is a field and thus an integral domain, we see that <m>\lambda^n=0</m> implies that <m>\lambda=0</m> as well.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        As this holds in the algebraic closure of <m>F</m> as well, we see that when factored into linear terms all the <m>\lambda=0</m>. 
                        Thus <m>\cp_A(x)=\cp_B(x)=x^5</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The possible invariant factors involving <m>x^5</m> are 
                        1. <m>\{x,x,x,x,x\}</m>, 
                        2. <m>\{x,x,x,x^2\}</m>, 
                        3. <m>\{x,x,x^3\}</m>, 
                        4. <m>\{x,x^2,x^2\}</m>, 
                        5. <m>\{x,x^4\}</m> 
                        6. <m>\{x^2,x^3\}</m> 
                        7. <m>\{x^5\}</m> 
                        However, in the first case the rank of <m>A</m> would be <m>5</m>, making it invertible, contradicting the fact that 0 is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>. 
                        Thus we need only consider the latter cases.

                        By Corollary 2.96, CITEX <m>F(\alpha)</m> is separable, so the minimal polynomial of <m>\alpha</m> in <m>F[x]</m> has no repeated root in <m>\overline{F}</m>. 
                        As <m>f</m> does have a repeated root (by supposition) it cannot be the minimum polynomial of <m>\alpha</m>. 
                        Thus <m>f(x)=\mp_{\alpha,F[x]}(x)g(x)</m> for some <m>g(x)\in F[x]</m> such that <m>g(x)</m> has <m>\alpha</m> as a root, otherwise <m>f</m> would not obtain its repeated root. 
                        However, this means that <m>\mp_{\alpha,F[x]}(x)\big|g(x)</m>, meaning that <m>g(x)</m> has <m>x-\alpha</m> as a factor as well. 
                        Thus we see that <m>x-\alpha</m> is a repeated factor of <m>f(x)</m>, one from the minimum polynomial, one from <m>g(x)</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose that the prime factorization of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m> admits a repeated factor. 
                        Thus there exists some prime (and thus irreducible) <m>g(x)</m> such that <m>g(x)g(x)|f(x)</m>. 
                        However, <m>g</m> has a root <m>\alpha</m> in <m>\overline{F}</m>, so in <m>F(\alpha)</m> we see that <m>f(x)</m> has <m>\alpha</m> as a root as well, as <m>g(a)=0</m>. 
                        But since <m>g(x)</m> has factor <m>x-\alpha</m>, it shows up twice in the factorization of <m>f</m> because <m>g(x)g(x)|f(x)</m>. 
                        So <m>\alpha</m> has multiplicity at least 2, so <m>f</m> is not separable.
                      </p>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Let <m>y,z</m> be indeterminants, <m>F=\F_{p}[y]</m>, and <m>L=\F_{p}[z]</m> such that <m>z^3=y</m> (as seen in Example 2.78). 
                        Note then that <m>z^3</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^p-y\in F[x]</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Moreover, since <m>F</m> is the field of fractions of the PID <m>R=\F_{p}[y]</m> and <m>y</m> is a prime element of <m>R</m>, we may apply <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> (using <m>p=y</m>) to conclude that <m>x^p-y</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>. 
                        Thus <m>x^p-y</m> is the minimum polynomial of <m>z</m> in <m>F[x]</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        However, as the derivative of this polynomial is <m>0</m>, we see that the <m>\mp_{z,F[x]}(x)</m> is not separable by Proposition 2.72. 
                        However, by the Freshman's Dream, we see that <m>x^3-y=x^p-z^p=(x-z)^p\in L</m>. 
                        But as <m>z\not\in F</m>, we see that the prime factorization of <m>x^p-y</m> admits no repeated factor.

                      <p>
                        Suppose every subgroup of <m>G</m> is normal. 
                        Let <m>d</m> be a positive divisor of <m>|G|</m>. 
                        For every prime <m>p</m> dividing the order of <m>G</m> there is exactly one Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>, given that Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups are normal if and only if they are unique. 
                        Thus <m>G</m> can be written as a direct product of its Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups. 
                        Given the prime factorization of <m>d</m>, the direct product of the Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups such that <m>p|d</m> is 1. 
                        A subgroup of <m>G</m> as each Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup is normal, and 2. 
                        A direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order, yielding an element of order <m>d</m>. 
                        The subgroup generated by this element is a subgroup of <m>G</m> of order <m>d</m>.

                      <p>
                        We take a peak at <m>G=A_4</m> with <m>d=6</m>. Suppose <m>A_4</m> had a subgroup of order <m>6</m>, <m>H</m>. First, note that <m>[G:H]=2</m>, the 
                        smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>, making <m>H</m> normal in <m>G</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        As there are eight <m>3</m>-cycles in <m>G</m>, there exists some <m>3</m>-cycle, <m>\sigma</m>, such that <m>\s\not\in H</m>. 
                        Consider then <m>H, \s H,</m> and <m>\s^2 H</m> in <m>G/H</m>. 
                        Since <m>|G/H|=\frac{|G|}{|H|}=2</m>, it must be the case that either <m>\s^2H=\s H</m> or <m>\s^2H=H</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            If <m>\s^2 H=H</m> then <m>\s^2\in H</m>. 
                            As <m>|\s|=3</m> we have <m>\s^2=\s\inv</m>, but as <m>H</m> is a subgroup this would mean <m>(\s\inv)\inv=\s\in H</m>, which is not the case.
                          </li>

                          <li>
                            If <m>\s^2 H=\s H</m> then <m>\s\inv\s^2\in H</m>, but <m>\s\inv\s^2=\s</m>, and so we have a contradiction. 
                            Thus <m>H</m> cannot exist, and <m>G</m> has no subgroup of order <m>6</m>.

                      <p>
                        By <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/> we know that <m>|\Orb_G(x)|\big||G|</m> for all <m>x\in X</m>. 
                        Thus every orbit under this action has an order dividing <m>p^n</m>, so either <m>1</m> or some positive power of <m>p</m>. 
                        However, as no element of <m>X</m> is fixed by every element of <m>G</m>, there exists no stabilizer which is all of <m>G</m>, and thus there exist no orbits that have order <m>1</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Recall that the orbits of this action partition <m>X</m>, and thus <m>|X|=\sum_{x\in X}|\Orb_G(x)|</m>. 
                        As every orbit is divisible by <m>p</m>, so too must be <m>X</m>.

                        Suppose <m>G</m> acts faithfully on <m>X</m>. 
                        Thus the permutation representation homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to\Perm(X)</m> is injective. 
                        Let <m>k</m> denote the order of <m>X</m>. 
                        Then <m>\Perm(X)\cong S_k</m>, which as order <m>k!</m>. 
                        As <m>G</m> is injective, we see that <m>|G|=|\im\rho|\leq S_k</m>, and thus <m>p^n|k!</m>.

                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>3^2\cdot 11\cdot 17</m>. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we see the following:

                    <li>
                      <p>

                      <p>
                        <m>n_{17}|99</m> and <m>n_{17}\equiv 1\mod{17}</m>, and so <m>n_{17}=1</m> as well. 
                        - <m>n_3|187</m> and <m>n_3\cong 1\mod{3}</m>, so actually <m>n_3=1</m> too. 
                        Thus the unique Sylow <m>11</m>-subgroup and Sylow <m>17</m>-subgroup, denoted <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, respectively, are normal in <m>G</m>.

                <p>
                  As <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are normal in <m>G</m> and intersect trivially, we see that <m>PQ\leq G</m>.

                  As <m>p\in P\nsg G</m> and <m>q\in Q\nsg G</m> we see <m>gpg\inv\in P</m> and <m>gqg\inv\in Q</m>, thus <m>gpqg\inv\in PQ</m>, making <m>PQ\nsg G</m>.

                <p>
                  Let <m>R</m> be the unique Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup, which has order <m>9</m>. 
                  As <m>R\nsg G</m> and intersects with <m>PQ</m> trivially, we see <m>G=PQ\times R</m>, a direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order, making <m>G</m> abelian.

                        Let <m>I</m> be an ideal in <m>R</m>, and let <m>S</m> denote the set of norms for a nonzero generating set of <m>I</m>. 
                        If none exist then <m>I=(0)</m> then in it is principally generated, so we can assume there is some nonzero <m>x\in I</m>, meaning our set <m>S</m> is nonempty.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        As <m>S</m> is a set of natural numbers bounded below, by the 
                        Least Upper Bound Axiom 
                        there exists a smallest element. 
                        Let <m>b</m> denote the nonzero element in <m>S</m> with smallest norm.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Suppose <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are nonzero elements of the generating set for <m>I</m>. 
                        As <m>R</m> is an ED there exist <m>q,r\in R</m> such that <m>a=qb+r</m> with either <m>r=0</m> or <m>N(r)&lt;N(b)</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Notice that <m>r=a-qb</m>, where <m>a\in I</m> and <m>-qb\in I</m> by absorption. 
                        Thus <m>r\in I</m>, meaning that <m>N(r)\geq N(b)</m>. 
                        Thus <m>r=0</m>. 
                        Then <m>a=qb</m>, meaning that <m>a\in (b)</m>. 
                        Thus every element in the generating set for <m>I</m> is contained in <m>(b)</m>, and thus <m>I=(b)</m>, making <m>I</m> principally generated.

                  Show that if <m>L</m> is algebraically closed, then <m>K</m> is algebraically closed.

                <p>
                  Let <m>L/F</m> be a field extension let <m>K := \{a\in L | a \text{ is algebraic over }F \}</m>, and suppose that <m>L</m> is algebraically closed. 
                  Thus every polynomial in <m>L[x]</m> has a root in <m>L</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let <m>f\in K[x]</m> and let <m>\a</m> be a root of <m>f</m>. 
                  Thus <m>f=a_nx^n + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0</m>, where each <m>a_i\in K</m>. 
                  By definition of <m>K</m>, each <m>a_i</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>. 
                  Notice that <m>f\in F(a_0,\dots,a_n)[x]</m> as well, making <m>\a</m> algebraic over this extension as well.

                <p>
                  Consider the chain of extensions

                  </me>
                  As <m>a_i</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m> for all <m>i</m> and <m>\a</m> is algebraic over <m>F(a_0,\dots,a_n)[x]</m> we see that each step in this chain has finite degree by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/>, 
                  <m>[F(a_0, \dots, a_{n}, \a): F]</m> is finite and thus so is <m>[F(\a):F]</m>. By the

                  Thus <m>\a</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, hence <m>\a\in K</m>, making <m>K</m> algebraically closed.

                        Since <m>K</m> is splitting field of <m>q(x)</m> over <m>\mathbb{Z}/p[x]</m>, <m>q</m> factors completely into linear factors over <m>K[x]</m>, and thus <m>q(x)</m> has <m>p^n</m> roots in <m>K</m> up to multiplicity. 
                        If we can show each root has multiplicity 1, then <m>|E|=p^n</m>. 
                        We will just show no roots of <m>q</m> are a root of <m>q'</m>.

                        Let <m>L</m> be a splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>\Q</m>. 
                        As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible, it is the minimum polynomial for some <m>\a\in L</m> such that <m>[\Q(\a):\Q]=5</m>. 
                        As <m>f</m> has complex roots, we know that <m>\Q(\a)\neq L</m>, and is thus an intermediate field. 
                        By the <xref ref="thm-ftgt" text="title"/> there exists a subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>\Gal(L/\Q)</m> such that <m>H=\Gal(\Q(\a)/\Q)</m>. 
                        As <m>[\Q(\a):\Q]=5</m> we know <m>|H|=5</m>, making <m>H=\langle\s\rangle</m> for some <m>\s\in H</m>. 
                        Thus <m>\s</m> is an element of order <m>5</m> in <m>\Gal(L/\Q)</m>. 
                        As <m>f</m> is a degree <m>5</m> polynomial, we know <m>\Gal(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_5</m>.

                  Since union in <m>S</m> and yields an upper bound, by Zorn's Lemma CITEX we have a maximal element. Thus <m>G</m> possesses maximal subgroups.

                        First, suppose <m>p&lt;q</m>. 
                        By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the following: 
                        <ul>
                          <li>

                              <m>n_p|q</m> and <m>n_p\equiv 1\mod{p}</m>, so <m>n_p=1</m> or <m>q</m>, so <m>q</m> 
                            </p>
                          </li>

                            <p>
                              <m>n_q|p^2</m> and <m>n_q\equiv 1\mod{q}</m>, so <m>n_q=1</m> or <m>p^2</m>, so <m>p^2</m>. 
                            </p>
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        We know there must be <m>(q-1)\cdot p^2=p^2q-p^2</m> elements of order <m>p</m>. 
                        Luckily, there is more than one Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup with <m>p^2</m> elements, so there isn't room for all of them.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Suppose then that <m>q&gt;p</m>. 
                        By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know <m>n_p|q</m> and <m>n_p\equiv 1\mod{p}</m>, so <m>n_p=1</m>, so we're definitely good there.

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Suppose <m>p &lt; q</m> and the Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup, <m>P</m>, is cyclic and normal. We know from Part (a) that there are either <m>1</m> or <m>p^2</m> Sylow <m>q</m>-subgroups, but since there are already <m>p^2</m> elements of order <m>p</m> there is only room for one, <m>Q</m>, which is also cyclic, given its prime power. As <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are thus normal in <m>G</m> and only intersect trivially, we see that <m>PQ=G</m>, meaning that <m>G=P\times Q</m>. Thus <m>G</m> is the product of two cyclic groups of relatively prime order, making <m>G</m> cyclic as well. Cyclic groups are abelian, so we are done.

                  Suppose by way of contradiction there exist <m>\a,\b</m> such that <m>2=\a\b</m>. 
                  Then <m>\a=a+b\sqrt{10}</m> and <m>\b=c+d\sqrt{10}</m>, and 
                  <me>
                    N(2)=4=N(\a\b)=N(\a)N(\b)=(a^2-10b^2)(c^2-10d^2).
                  </me> 
                  Thus <m>(a^2-10b^2)=\pm1,\pm2,</m> or <m>\pm4</m>, as these are the only integer divisors of <m>4</m>. 
                  However, there do not exist integers <m>a,b</m> such that this is true. 
                  Thus <m>2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Z[\sqrt{10}]</m>.

                <p>
                  First, suppose there exists some <m>a+b\sqrt{10}</m> such that <m>2(a+b\sqrt{10})=(4\pm\sqrt{10})</m>. 
                  Thus <m>2a+2b\sqrt{10}=4\pm\sqrt{10}</m>, and so <m>2b=\pm1</m>. 
                  However, <m>\pm\frac12</m> is not an integer, and thus <m>2</m> cannot divide either of these factors.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Recall that a <m>\Z</m>-module <m>M</m> is called <em>torsion-free</em> if its torsion submodule is <m>\Tor(M ) =\{0\},</m> where <m>\Tor(M ) = \{m \in M | rm = 0 \text{ for some }r \in \Z\setminus\{0\}\}.</m> 
                  Consider the <m>\Z</m>-module 
                  <me>
                    M= \frac{\Z \oplus \Z}{\langle(7, 11)\rangle }\text{ where }\langle(7, 11)\rangle = \{(7k, 11k) | k \in \Z\}.
                  </me> 
                  Show that <m>M</m> is torsion free.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  Let <m>m=(a,b)\in\Tor(M)</m>. 
                  Thus <m>rm=0</m> for some nonzero <m>r\in\Z</m>. 
                  Then <m>(ra,rb)=0</m>, and so <m>ra=0</m> and <m>rb=0</m>.
                  Then there exists <m>p,q\in\Z</m> such that <m>7p=ra</m> and <m>7q=rb</m> or <m>11p=ra</m> and and <m>11q=rb</m>. 
                  Notice that in <m>M</m> we have <m>7,11=0</m>, and thus neither <m>7</m> nor <m>11</m> can divide <m>r</m>. 
                  Suppose <m>7p=ra</m> and <m>7q=rb</m>. As <m>7</m> cannot divide <m>r</m> we see that <m>7</m> divides both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, placing them both <m>\langle(7, 11)\rangle</m>. 
                  Thus <m>m=0</m>. 
                  The same holds true if we use <m>11</m>. 
                  Thus <m>m=0</m> and <m>\Tor(M)=\{0\}</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  (ALTERNATE SOLUTION)
                  To show <m>M</m> is torsion-free we need to show that <m>\text{Tor}(M)=\{0\}</m>. 
                  The fact that <m>\{0\}\subseteq \text{Tor}(M)</m> is beyond trivial, so we just need to show that <m>\text{Tor}(M)\subseteq \{0\}</m>.
                  <!-- linebreak --><!-- linebreak -->
                  So let <m>(x,y)+\langle(7,11)\rangle\in \text{Tor}(M)</m>. 
                  Thus there exists an <m>r\neq 0\in \mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m>r((x,y)+\langle (7,11)\rangle )=(rx,ry)+\langle (7,11)\rangle=(0,0)+\langle (7,11)\rangle</m>.
                  <!-- linebreak --><!-- linebreak -->
                  This implies that <m>(rx,ry)-(0,0)=(rx,ry)\in \langle (7,11)\rangle</m>. 
                  By definition, this means that <m>(rx,ry)=(7k,11k)</m> for some <m>k\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. 
                  This gives us two equations: 
                  <me>
                    \begin{aligned} rx=7k\\ ry=11k \end{aligned}
                  </me> 
                  From this we can see that 
                  <me>
                    \begin{aligned} k=\frac{rx}{7}\\ k=\frac{ry}{11} \end{aligned}
                  </me> 
                  and therefore <m>\frac{rx}{7}=\frac{ry}{11}\iff 11rx=7ry\iff 11x=7y</m>. 
                  Since 7 and 11 are each prime, it must be that <m>7|x</m> and <m>11|y</m>. 
                  So <m>x=7m</m> and <m>y=11n</m> for some <m>m,n\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. 
                  Therefore we get 
                  <me>
                    11\cdot 7m=7\cdot 11n\iff m=n
                  </me> 
                  So we get exactly that <m>x=7m,y=11m\implies (x,y)\in \langle(7,11)\rangle</m> and therefore <m>(x,y)+\langle (7,11)\rangle =(0,0)+\langle (7,11)\rangle</m>. 
                  Finally we find that <m>\text{Tor}(M)\subseteq \{0\}\implies \text{Tor}(M)=\{0\}</m>.

                        Thus <m>\cp_A(x)</m> will be given by the determinant of the matrix

                        Thus each linear term is an elementary divisor. 
                        However, as none of these elementary divisors divide any of the others, we see that the only invariant factor is <m>\cp_AT(x)</m> itself.

                        As each linear term is an elementary divisor, each Jordan block a <m>1\times1</m> matrix with <m>i</m> as the only entry. 
                        Thus the Jordan Canonical form is

                  Let <m>E, K,</m> and <m>L</m> be subfields of a field <m>F</m> with <m>E \subseteq K</m> and <m>E \subseteq L</m>.

                      <p>
                        We're going to go slightly out of order. 
                        By Part (b), we see <m>[KL : E] = k\ell</m> when <m>\gcd(k,\ell) = 1</m>. 
                        This is the largest possible size of <m>KL</m>, as everything is irreducible where it can be. 
                        Thus <m>[KL : E] \leq k\ell</m>
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Suppose <m>\gcd(k,\ell) = 1</m>. 
                        As <m>K</m> and <m>L</m> are finite extensions of <m>E</m> they are also algebraic. 
                        Thus there exists <m>\a\in K</m> and <m>\b\in L</m> such that <m>\mp_\a(x)</m> has degree <m>k</m> and <m>\mp_\b(x)</m> has degree <m>\ell</m>.

                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Thus <m>\gcd(\deg\mp_\a(x),\ell) = 1</m>, making <m>\mp_\a(x)</m> irreducible in <m>L[x]</m>. 
                        Thus <m>[L(\a):L]=k</m>. 
                        Notice that <m>E(\a,\b)=KL</m>, as it is the smallest (with respect to containment) subfield of <m>F</m> which satisfies <m>K\subseteq KL</m> and <m>L\subseteq KL</m>. 
                        Thus we have <m>[KL:E]=k\ell</m>, as desired.

                        Notice that <m>KL=K=L</m>, and thus <m>[KL:E]=[L:E]=\ell&lt;\ell^2=k\ell</m>.

                  First, notice that <m>xy</m> and <m>x+y</m> are contained in <m>F(x,y)</m>. 
                  As <m>y</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, it is the root of some polynomial <m>f</m> with coefficients in <m>f</m>. 
                  But <m>f</m> is also contained in <m>F(x)</m>, and thus the extension <m>[F(x,y):F(x)]</m> is algebraic. 
                  As <m>[F(x):F]</m> is algebraic as well, we see that <m>[F(x,y):F]</m> is an algebraic extension of fields. 
                  Thus <m>xy</m> and <m>x+y</m> are algebraic over <m>F</m>.

                  (Note: You may use the fact that <m>A_n</m> is a <m>\Z</m>-module without proof.)

                  In <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>-modules, <m>f</m> is a module homomorphism iff <m>f</m> is a group homomorphism. 
                  One direction is trivial since it is in the definition. 
                  To show that for <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>-modules a group homomorphism is a module homomorphism let <m>f</m> be a group homomorphism. 
                  Let <m>n\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. 
                  <m>f(ng)=f(\underbrace{g+g+\cdots +g)}_\text{n times}=\underbrace{f(g)+\cdots f(g)}_\text{n times}=nf(g)</m> so <m>f</m> preserves scalar multiplication. 
                  It already preserved addition, so therefore it as a <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>-module homomorphism.
                  
                  Thus for <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>-modules we can utilize the UMP for cyclic groups when our abelian group is cyclic, as is <m>\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}</m>. 
                  Every <m>h</m> in <m>\text{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},A)</m> is uniquely defined by where <m>h</m> sends 1. 
                  Specifically, it has to go to an element in <m>A</m> such that <m>na=0</m>. 
                  So let <m>f:\text{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},A)\to A_n</m> such that <m>f(h)=h(1)</m>. 
                  First we will show this is well defined. 
                  Since by assumption <m>nh(1)=0</m> and <m>h</m> maps to elements in <m>A</m>, <m>h(1)\in A_n</m>. 
                  So it is well-defined.
                  
                  Now to show that <m>f</m> is one-to-one and onto. 
                  For one-to-one let <m>f(h)=0</m> and therefore <m>h(1)=0</m>. 
                  If the generator is sent to 0, then everything is sent to 0, so <m>f</m> is the zero map, and thus the kernel is trivial. 
                  For onto let <m>a\in A_n</m>. Since it is in <m>A_n</m> we know that <m>na=0</m> so we can define a group/module homomorphism <m>f:\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\to A</m> by <m>f(1)=a</m> due to the UMP. 
                  <m>h(f)=f(1)=a</m> so it is onto. Bijective module homomorphisms are isomorphisms so we have that they are isomorphic.

                Every matrix is similar to a unique matrix in RCF by <xref ref="cor-every-matrix-similar-to-unique-rcf-matrix"/>. 
                Note that RCF is based on the invariant factors if a matrix, and thus if two matrices have the same invariant factors they will have the same RCF, making them both similar to the same (unique) matrix, making them similar to each other.
                By part (1) of this [[Theorem â Cayley-Hamilton Theorem|Theorem]], the characteristic polynomial of a matrix is equal to the product of the invariant factors of that same matrix.

              <p>

                        Let <m>\a\in L</m>. 
                        By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we have <m>[K:F(a)]=[K:F(\a)][F(\a):F]</m>. 
                        Thus <m>[F(\a):F]</m> is finite, making <m>\a</m> algebraic over <m>F</m>.

                        Notice that <m>\a_n\sqrt[n]2\in\overline{\Q}</m> for all <m>n\in\N</m> and that <m>\a_n</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^n-2</m>, which is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> (<m>p=2</m>). 
                        Thus <m>[\Q(\a_n):\Q]=n</m>. As <m>\a_n</m> must be added to <m>\Q</m> for all <m>n</m>, we see that this extension is not finite.

                        To show <m>\bar{\mathbb{Q}}</m> is an algebraic extension, we need to show that for each <m>\alpha\in \bar{\mathbb{Q}}</m> there exists and <m>f(x)\in \mathbb{Q}[x]</m> such that <m>\alpha</m> is a root of <m>f</m>. 
                        But this is true by the definition of <m>\bar{\mathbb{Q}}</m>.
                        
                        To show this let <m>n\geq 1</m> be an integer. 
                        By CITEX Eisenstein's <m>x^n-p</m> for some prime <m>p</m> is irreducible over <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>. 
                        Therefore <m>\sqrt[n]{p}\in \bar{\mathbb{Q}}</m> and <m>[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{p}):\mathbb{Q}]=n\implies [E:\mathbb{Q}]\geq n</m> for each <m>n\geq 1</m> therefore <m>[E:\mathbb{Q}]=\infty</m>.

                <p>
                  Let <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> be groups.
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        First, let <m>\psi\in\Aut(H)</m> and <m>\phi\in\Aut(K)</m>. 
                        Let <m>\varphi:H\times K\to H\times K</m> be defined by <m>\varphi(h,k)=(\psi(h),\phi(k))</m>. 
                        Let <m>(h,k)\in H\times K</m>. As <m>\psi,\phi</m> automorphisms, there exist <m>h',k'</m> such that <m>\psi(h')=h</m> and <m>\phi(k')=k</m>. 
                        Thus we have surjectivity, and hence bijectivity, given the equal cardinalities. 
                        The homomorphism element is verifiable, I'll do it later. 
                        Thus <m>\varphi</m> is indeed an automorphism of <m>H\times K</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Define <m>f:\Aut(H)\times \Aut(K)\to\Aut(H\times K)</m> by <m>f(\psi,\phi)=\varphi</m>. 
                        Suppose two elements map to the same place. 
                        Then they were the same! 
                        Thus, by the First Isomorphism CITEX, we have the result.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Let <m>H = K = \mathbb{Z}_2</m>, the cyclic group of order <m>2</m>. 
                        Then <m>\Aut(H) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2</m> since there is only one non-identity automorphism (namely, the map that sends the generator to its inverse), and <m>\Aut(K) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2</m> for the same reason. 
                        Therefore, <m>\Aut(H) \times \Aut(K) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2</m>, which is abelian.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        On the other hand, <m>H\times K \cong \mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2</m> is also abelian. 
                        Let <m>\varphi</m> be the nontrivial automorphism of <m>\mathbb{Z}_2</m>, which sends <m>0</m> to <m>1</m> and <m>1</m> to <m>0</m>. 
                        Then the automorphism <m>(g,h) \mapsto (\varphi(g), \varphi(h))</m> is nontrivial and sends <m>(0,0)</m> to itself, so it is an automorphism of <m>H\times K</m>. 
                        Therefore, <m>\Aut(H\times K)</m> contains a nonabelian subgroup, and in particular <m>\Aut(H) \times \Aut(K)</m> is not isomorphic to <m>\Aut(H\times K)</m>.

                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        <m>n_5|</m> and <m>n_5\equiv1\mod{5}</m>, so <m>n_5=1</m> as well.

                  Suppose by way of contradiction there exist <m>\a,\b</m> such that <m>2=\a\b</m>. 
                  Then <m>\a=a+b\sqrt{-3}</m> and <m>\b=c+d\sqrt{-3}</m>, and 
                  <me>N(2)=4=N(\a\b)=N(\a)N(\b)=(a^2+3b^2)(c^2+3d^2).</me> 
                  Thus <m>(a^2+3b^2)=\pm1,\pm2,</m> or <m>\pm4</m>, as these are the only integer divisors of <m>4</m>. 
                  However, there do not exist integers <m>a,b</m> such that this is true. 
                  Thus <m>2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-3}]</m>.

                  Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>2</m> is prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-3}]</m>. 
                  Note that <m>2|6=(1+\sqrt{-3})(1-\sqrt{-3})</m>. 
                  Thus <m>2</m> divides one of these factors.
                </p>

                <p>
                  First, suppose there exists some <m>a+b\sqrt{-3}</m> such that <m>2(a+b\sqrt{-3})=(1\pm\sqrt{-3})</m>. 
                  Thus <m>2a+2b\sqrt{-5}=1\pm\sqrt{-3}</m>, and so <m>2a=\pm1</m>. 
                  However, <m>\pm\frac12</m> is not an integer, and thus <m>2</m> cannot divide either of these factors. 
                  Thus <m>2</m> is not prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-3}]</m>.

                        Not so bad! Now, the invariant factors all divide the characteristic polynomial and must divide the following factor, so our options for sets of invariant factors are the following:

                        - <m>\{(x+1),-x(x+1)\}</m> 
                        However, the largest invariant factor is also the minimal polynomial. 
                        So we check to see if <m>-A(A+I)=0</m>. 
                        Luckily, the very first calculation shows that this is not the case. 
                        Thus the minimum polynomial is the characteristic polynomial is the only invariant factor of <m>A</m>. 
                        Thus the RCF of <m>A</m> is 
                        <me>C(-x^3-2x^2-x)=\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2\end{bmatrix}.</me>

                        Luckily for us, <m>\cp_A(x)</m> factors completely into linear terms! So our elementary divisors are <m>-x</m> and <m>(x+1)^2</m>.
                         We see <m>J_1(0)=\begin{bmatrix} 0 \end{bmatrix}</m> and <m>J_2(-1)=\begin{bmatrix} -1 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}</m>, so the Jordan Canonical form of <m>A</m> is

                        First, notice that <m>e\cdot x=exe=x</m> for all <m>x\in S</m>.
                        Next, let <m>g,h\in G</m> and consider <m>gh\cdot x=ghx(gh)\inv=ghxh\inv g\inv=g\cdot(h\cdot x)</m>. 
                        Thus <m>G</m> acts on <m>S</m> by conjugation.

                        Suppose <m>Z(G)</m> is trivial, and let <m>G</m> act on <m>S</m> by conjugation.
                        Thus the orbits of this action correspond the normalizers of elements and the stabilizers correspond to the centralizers. 
                        Recall that the orbits of this action partition <m>S</m>, so we have
                        <me>|S|=\sum\limits_{x\in S}|\Orb_G(x)|</me>
                        for distinct orbits. 
                        However, by <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/> we also have <m>|G|=|\Orb(x)|\cdot |\Stab(x)|</m> for all <m>x\in S</m>.

                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the following:
                  - <m>n_3|25</m> and <m>n_{3}\equiv1\mod{3}</m>, so our options are <m>1</m> and <m>25</m>. 
                  - <m>n_5|3</m> and <m>n_{3}\equiv1\mod{5}</m>, so there can only be one. 
                  Let <m>P</m> denote the unique Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroup, which has order <m>25</m> and is normal in <m>G</m>. 
                  As <m>P</m> is a group of order <m>p^2</m> we know that it is abelian. 
                  Thus there are only two options for <m>P</m> up to isomorphism: <m>\Z_5\times\Z_5</m> and <m>\Z_{25}</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let <m>Q</m> denote a Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup. 
                  All Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups are isomorphic to each other and there is only one group of order <m>3</m>, which is <m>\Z_3</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Suppose <m>P=\Z_{25}</m>. 
                  As <m>G = PQ</m> and <m>P\cap Q = \{e\}</m>, we have that <m>G = P\sdp_\phi Q</m>, where <m>\phi : Q \to\Aut(P)</m>. 
                  Note that <m>\Aut(P)\cong\Z^\times_{25}</m>, which is cyclic of order <m>20</m>. 
                  Since <m>|Q| = 3</m> and <m>\gcd(3,20) = 1</m>, we conclude that <m>\phi</m> must be the trivial map. 
                  Hence, <m>G = P\times Q</m>.

                  Let <m>G</m> act on <m>\Syl_2(P)</m> by conjugation, yielding the permutation representation homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to S_{n_2}</m>.
                  The kernel of this homomorphism cannot be trivial as the conjugation action on Sylow subgroups is transitive by Part (2) of <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>. 
                  Notice that if <m>n_2</m> is <m>3</m> or <m>5</m> then <m>|G|</m> does not divide the order of <m>S_{n_2}</m>, so our kernel cannot be all of <m>G</m>, making <m>\ker(\rho)</m> a nontrivial normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.

                <p>
                  If <m>n_2=7</m>, then <m>G</m> must divide <m>7!</m>, meaning that <m>m=1</m>. 
                  However, by the cyclic subgroup generated by an element of order <m>7</m> has index <m>2</m> in <m>G</m>, making it normal.

                  Thus <m>G</m> cannot be simple.

                      <p>
                        Let <m>R</m> be a UFD.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        First, suppose <m>p</m> is irreducible, and consider the ideal <m>(p)</m>. Let <m>a,b\in R</m> such that <m>ab\in(p)</m>. 
                        Thus <m>p|ab</m>, so there exists some <m>k\in R</m> such that <m>pk=ab</m>. 
                        As we are in a UFD the elements <m>a,b,</m> and <m>k</m> all have unique (up to associates) factorizations of irreducible elements. 
                        Thus <m>p</m> must be an associate of one of the irreducible elements in the factorization of <m>a</m> or <m>b</m>, and so <m>a\in(p)</m> or <m>b\in(p)</m>, making <m>(p)</m> prime.
                      </p>
      
                      <p>
                        Now suppose that <m>(p)</m> is prime and that <m>p=ab</m> for some <m>ab\in R</m>. 
                        Thus <m>p|ab</m> and <m>ab\in(p)</m>, so either <m>a\in(p)</m> or <m>b\in(p)</m>, as <m>(p)</m> is a prime ideal. 
                        Assume without loss of generality that <m>a|p</m>. 
                        Thus <m>ak=p</m> for some <m>k\in R</m>. 
                        Thus <m>ab=pkb</m> and <m>p=pkb</m> 
                        As UFDs are integral domains we see <m>kb=1</m>, making <m>b</m> a unit. 
                        Thus <m>p</m> is irreducible.

                        First, notice that <m>2\cdot 3=6=(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})</m>. 
                        Define a function 
                        <me>N:\Z[\sqrt{-5}]\to\Z, N(a+b \sqrt{-5})=a^2+5b^2.</me> 
                        Let <m>\alpha,\beta\in\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m> and behold

                        N(\alpha)N(\beta)&amp;=(a^2+5b^2)(c^2+5d^2).\end{align}</me>
                        So there's that done.

                      <p>
                        Suppose by way of contradiction there exist <m>\a,\b</m> such that <m>2=\a\b</m>. 
                        Then <m>\a=a+b\sqrt{-5}</m> and <m>\b=c+d\sqrt{-5}</m>, and 
                        <me>N(2)=4=N(\a\b)=N(\a)N(\b)=(a^2+5b^2)(c^2+5d^2).</me> 
                        Thus <m>(a^2+5b^2)=\pm1,\pm2,</m> or <m>\pm4</m>, as these are the only integer divisors of <m>4</m>. 
                        However, there do not exist integers <m>a,b</m> such that this is true. 
                        Thus <m>2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>.
                      </p>
      
                      <p>
                        Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>2</m> is prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>. 
                        Note that <m>2|6=(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})</m>. 
                        Thus <m>2</m> divides one of these factors.
                      </p>
      
                      <p>
                        First, suppose there exists some <m>a+b\sqrt{-5}</m> such that <m>2(a+b\sqrt{-5})=(1\pm\sqrt{-5})</m>. 
                        Thus <m>2a+2b\sqrt{-5}=1\pm\sqrt{-5}</m>, and so <m>2a=\pm1</m>. 
                        However, <m>\pm\frac12</m> is not an integer, and thus <m>2</m> cannot divide either of these factors. 
                        Thus <m>2</m> is not prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>. 
                        By Part (a), this is not a UFD.

                  Let <m>[L:F]=n</m>
                </p>

                <p>
                  First, note that if <m>d=1</m> then <m>f</m> is always irreducible, so we may reduce to the case where <m>d&gt;1</m>.

                  Let <m>K</m> denote the algebraic closure of <m>F</m>, let <m>\a</m> be a root of <m>f\in K</m>, and consider <m>F(\a)</m> and <m>L(\a)</m>. 
                  Let <m>g(x)</m> denote the minimal polynomial of <m>\a\in L(\a)</m>, and let <m>\deg(g)=q</m>. 
                  Thus <m>[L(\a):L]=q</m>. 
                  By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we have 
                  - <m>[L(\a):F]=[L(\a):L][L:F]=qn</m> 
                  - <m>[L(\a):F]=[L(\a):F(a)][F(a):F]=md</m> for some <m>m\in \N</m>. 
                  Thus <m>qn=md</m> and <m>md|qn</m>. 
                  As <m>n</m> and <m>d</m> are relatively prime we have <m>d|q</m>. 
                  However, <m>q</m> is the minimal polynomial of <m>\a</m>, and thus <m>q\leq d</m>, yielding <m>q=d</m>. 
                  Thus <m>f=kg</m> for some <m>k\in F</m>. 
                  As irreducible polynomials multiplied by a constant are still irreducible, we see that <m>f</m> is indeed irreducible in <m>K[x]</m>.

                        Thus <m>a+b, a\inv,</m> and <m>ab</m> are algebraic over <m>F</m> as well, making <m>K</m> a field.

                  Let <m>f(x) \in \Q[x]</m> be an irreducible cubic (degree <m>3</m>) polynomial having exactly one real root, and let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>\Q</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>f</m>, it is a normal extension. 
                  As <m>\Q</m> has characteristic <m>0</m>, <m>L</m> is separable (because <m>L</m> is algebraic extension, as its the extension caused by adjoining each root of <m>f</m>, and algebraic extensions of algebraic extensions are algebraic). 
                  Thus by we see <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)|=[L:F]</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  By Proposition 2.83 CITEX we see that <m>\Aut(L/F)</m> is isomorphic to some subgroup of <m>S_m</m>, where <m>m</m> is the number of distinct roots of <m>f</m>. 
                  As <m>f</m> cubic and irreducible we know that the real root must be irrational, which we will denote <m>\alpha</m>. 
                  Consider the extension <m>\Q(\alpha)</m>. 
                  As <m>\alpha\not\in\Q</m>, we see that <m>[\Q(\alpha):\Q]\geq 2</m>. 
                  However, neither of our complex roots are in this extension, and so another extension is needed to reach <m>L</m>. 
                  But this extension would also have a degree larger than <m>1</m>, so <m>[L:\Q]\geq4</m>. 
                  As <m>|S_2|=2</m>, there exists no subgroup of it that <m>\Aut(L/F)</m> can be isomorphic to, given that <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)|=[L:F]</m>. 
                  Thus we see that <m>m=3</m>, meaning that our complex roots are distinct.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Then <m>|\Aut(L/F)|=1,2,3,</m> or <m>6</m>, the only possible sizes of subgroups of <m>S_3</m>. 
                  However, by the previous argument we see that as <m>[L:\Q]\geq4</m>, the only viable subgroup of <m>S_3</m> is <m>S_3</m> itself. 
                  Thus <m>\Aut(L/\Q) \cong S_3</m>.

                  Prove that no group of order <m>2^m \cdot 5</m> with <m>m\geq 1</m> is simple.

                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>2^m \cdot 5</m> with <m>m \leq 1</m>, and suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> is simple. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the following: 
                  - <m>n_{5}|2^m</m> and <m>n_5\equiv1\mod{5}</m>, and 
                  - <m>n_{2}|5</m> and <m>n_{2}\equiv1\mod{2}</m>, so our options are <m>3</m> and <m>5</m>. 
                  Suppose its <m>3</m>. Let <m>G</m> act on <m>\Syl_2(P)</m> by conjugation, yielding the permutation representation homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to S_{3}</m>. 
                  The kernel of this homomorphism cannot be trivial as the conjugation action on Sylow subgroups is transitive by Part (2) of <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>. 
                  Notice <m>|G|</m> does not divide the order of <m>S_{3}</m>, so our kernel cannot be all of <m>G</m>, making <m>\ker(\rho)</m> a nontrivial normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If <m>n_2=5</m>, then <m>G</m> must divide <m>5!</m>, meaning that <m>m=1</m>. 
                  However, by the cyclic subgroup generated by an element of order <m>5</m> has index <m>2</m> in <m>G</m>, making it normal.

                <p>
                  Thus <m>G</m> cannot be simple.

                        Consider, if you will, a group of order <m>p^{j+1}</m>, <m>H</m>. 
                        As this is a <m>p</m>-group, by Part (a) the center is nontrivial, making it a <m>p</m> group as well, and thus it has a subgroup of order <m>p</m>, <m>K</m>, which is normal in <m>H</m> as it lies within the center, so we mod out by <m>K</m> to see that <m>H</m> has a subgroup of order <m>p^j</m>, which has subgroups of all the other powers by the induction hypothesis.

                  Let <m>p</m> be any positive prime integer.
                </p>

                <p>
                  First, suppose <m>p=2</m>. 
                  Thus <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>pq</m>, making it abelian. 
                  So the only groups of order <m>6</m> are <m>\Z_2\times\Z_3</m> and <m>\Z_6</m>. 
                  The same applies when <m>p=2</m>, where the groups are <m>\Z_3\times\Z_3</m> and <m>\Z_9</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let <m>P</m> be a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>, and note that <m>[G:P]=3</m>, the smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>, making <m>P\nsg G</m>. 
                  Let <m>Q</m> denote a Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. 
                  As <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are groups of relatively prime order we have <m>PQ=G</m> and thus <m>G\cong P\sdp_\rho Q</m>, where <m>\rho:Q\to\Aut(P)</m>. 
                  Notice that since <m>|P|=p</m>, we have <m>\Aut(P)\cong\Z^{\times}_p\cong\Z_{p-1}</m>. 
                  Thus, by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/> <m>Q/\ker(\rho)\cong\im(\rho)\leq\Z_{p-1}.</m> As <m>Q</m> has three elements, the kernel of <m>\rho</m> must be either all of <m>Q</m> or trivial. 
                  However, the order of the image must divide <m>\Z_{p-1}</m>, which is only possible when <m>p\equiv 1 \mod 3</m>. 
                  Thus when this is the case there are two groups of order <m>3p</m>, otherwise the kernel is always trivial and we have <m>G=P\times Q</m> as the only group.

                  By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory CITEX, <m>H</m> corresponds to an intermediate field extension <m>E</m>. 
                  Note that as <m>H</m> has order 5, we see that <m>[G:H]=9</m>, and thus <m>[L:E]=9</m> as well.

                  You may use, without proof, the fact that <m>|\Aut(K/E)|\leq [K : E]</m> for any finite extension of fields <m>E \sse K.</m>
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  Let <m>F \sse L</m> is a finite extension of fields and that the characteristic of <m>F</m> is <m>p</m>, where <m>p</m> is a prime, and suppose there exists an element <m>\a\in L\setminus F</m> such that <m>\a^p \in F</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Consider the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^{p}-\a^p\in F[x]</m>, and notice that <m>f'(x)=px^{p-1}=0</m>, as we are in a field of characteristic <m>p</m>. 
                  However, this characteristic also yields <m>x^p-\a^p=(x-\a)^p</m>. 
                  As <m>F</m> is a field we have <m>F[x]</m> as a UFD, and thus as <m>x-\a</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> it is also prime. 
                  Therefore this is the unique factorization of <m>f</m> up to associates. 
                  If <m>f</m> was reducible <m>F</m> it would thus have to be divisible into power as <m>x-\a</m>, which will never be reducible as <m>\a\not\in F</m>. 
                  Thus <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>, making it the minimal polynomial of <m>\a</m>. 
                  However, if <m>|\Aut(L/F )|= [L : F ]</m> this would make <m>L</m> the splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>F</m>, which it is not, given <m>\a\not\in F</m>. 
                  Thus <m>|\Aut(L/F )| &lt; [L : F ]</m>.

                  Prove <m>T</m> is diagonalizable if and only if its minimum polynomial factors into distinct linear factors.

              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose that <m>g</m> is diagonalizable. 
                  Thus there exists a change of basis matrix <m>A</m> such that <m>A</m> is diagonal. 
                  As it is diagonal, its diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of <m>g</m>, and thus the roots of the minimal polynomial of <m>g</m>. 
                  Using row and column operations we can rearrange <m>A</m> so that all repeated linear factors are next to each other in the diagonal, for convenience.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We know that <m>\mp_A(x)</m> is the smallest monic polynomial that sends <m>A</m> to 0. 
                  Take all the distinct eigenvalues <m>\lambda_i</m> and consider <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We examine <m>q(A)</m>. 
                  It will be a product of matrices, one for each <m>\lambda_i</m>. 
                  First, take the first matrix in this product, <m>(A-\lambda_1I)</m>, and note that it sends all <m>\lambda_1</m> in <m>A</m> to 0. 
                  Thus all of the rows and columns that contained a <m>\lambda_1</m> are now 0, and thus all these rows and columns will be 0 in the final product <m>q(A)</m>. 
                  As this is we set <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m> for all <m>l\lambda_i\in A</m>, we see that for each row and column in <m>A</m> there will exist a matrix <m>A-\lambda_iI</m> in the product <m>q(A)</m> such that the row and column will be 0. 
                  Thus the entire matrix will be 0, and <m>q(A)=0</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Note that if any <m>\lambda_i</m> were excluded from <m>q(x)</m> there would exist a non-zero row and column for every matrix in the product, and thus <m>q</m> would not send <m>A</m> to 0. 
                  Thus <m>q(x)</m> is indeed the minimal polynomial of <m>A</m>. 
                  As <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m>, we see it does indeed factor into distinct linear terms.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose the minimum polynomial of <m>g</m> factors completely into distinct linear factors, each of which has the form <m>x-\lambda_i</m> for some <m>\lambda_i\in F</m>. 
                  As each <m>\lambda_i</m> is distinct, each elementary divisor is of the form <m>(x-\lambda_i)^1</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We construct the Jordan Canonical Form of <m>g</m>. 
                  As the elementary divisors are linear the Jordan blocks are <m>1\times1</m> matrices, making the <m>JCF</m> a diagonal matrix. 
                  As the JCF is itself a change of basis matrix, we see that <m>g</m> is diagonalizable.

                  Let <m>G</m> be a finite group of odd order, and let <m>G</m> act on itself via conjugation. 
                  Under this action, the orbit of an element is exactly its conjugacy class. 
                  By the <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/> we have <m>|G|=|\Orb(x)|\cdot|\Stab(x)|</m>.

                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>75</m>.
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Suppose <m>G</m> has an element of order <m>25</m>. 
                        Let <m>H</m> be the cyclic subgroup generated by this element, and notice that <m>[G:H]=3</m>, the smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>. 
                        Thus <m>H\nsg G</m>. Let <m>K</m> be a Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. 
                        Notice that this group has order <m>3</m> and is thus cyclic as well. 
                        Thus we have <m>G\cong H\sdp_{\rho}K</m>, where <m>\rho:K\to\Aut(H)</m> is a homomorphism. 
                        Note that <m>\Aut(H)\cong\Z^\times_{25}</m>, which is cyclic of order <m>20</m>. 
                        Since <m>|K| = 3</m> and <m>\gcd(3,20) = 1</m>, we conclude that <m>\rho</m> must be the trivial map. 
                        Hence, <m>G = H\times K</m>, which is a direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order. 
                        Hence, <m>G</m> is cyclic.

                  Let <m>L</m> be the splitting field over <m>\Q</m> of the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^3-7</m>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        First, notice that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> <m>(p=7)</m>. 
                        Let <m>\z</m> denote a primitive third root of unity. 
                        The roots of <m>f</m> are the following: 
                        1. <m>\a_1=\sqrt[3]{7}\z</m>, 
                        2. <m>\a_2=\sqrt[3]{7}\z^2</m>, and 
                        3. <m>\a_3=\sqrt[3]{7}\z^3=\sqrt[3]{7}</m>. 
                        As <m>f</m> is irreducible and monic we see that it is the minimal polynomial of <m>\a_3</m> over <m>\Q</m>. 
                        Let <m>E_1=\Q(\a_3)</m> and notice <m>[E_1:\Q]=3</m>.
                      </p>
      
                      <p>
                        Recall that <m>G=\Gal(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_3</m>. 
                        As <m>E_1\sse \R</m> and <m>\a_1\not\in\R</m>, we see another extension is needed, and that extension will have at least degree <m>2</m>. 
                        Thus, due to size constraints, we see <m>G\cong S_3</m>.
                      </p>
      
                      <p>
                        By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftgt"/> each Galois intermediate extension between <m>\Q</m> and <m>L</m> corresponds to a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, which are the normal subgroups of <m>S_3</m>.
                      </p>
      
                      <p>
                        The elements of <m>S_3</m> are the following: 
                        1. <m>(1)</m> 
                        2. <m>(12)</m>
                        3. <m>(13)</m> 
                        4. <m>(23)</m> 
                        5. <m>(123)</m> 
                        6. <m>(132)</m> 
                        The subgroup <m>F=\langle(123)\rangle=\{(123),(132)\}</m> has index <m>2</m> in <m>G</m> and is thus normal. 
                        None of the order <m>2</m> subgroups are normal in <m>S_3</m>, so <m>F</m> is the only strictly intermediate extension.
                      </p>
      
                      <p>
                        Recall <m>[E_1:\Q]=3</m>, meaning <m>|\Gal(L/E_1)|=3</m>, so <m>E</m> corresponds to a subgroup of order <m>2</m> in <m>G</m>, so its not Galois unfortunately. 
                        However, <m>E_2=\Q(\z)</m> is a degree <m>2</m> extension that is an intermediate field, as <m>\z</m> is a root of the irreducible polynomial <m>x^2+x+1</m>.

                        With all this in mind, notice: 
                        - <m>\Q</m> is a splitting field of <m>\Q</m>, and has the primitive generator by <m>1</m>. 
                        - <m>E_2</m> is our only strictly intermediate field, and has the primitive generator <m>\z</m> 
                        - Finally, <m>L</m> is Galois over <m>\Q</m>, and has the primitive generator <m>\z+\sqrt[3]{7}</m>.

                        As <m>x^2+1</m> is irreducible and monic, we see that <m>[\Q(\sqrt[4]{p},i):\Q(\sqrt[4]{p})]=2</m>. 
                        By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we have <m>[\Q(\sqrt[4]{p},i):\Q]=8</m>. 
                        Note that the four roots of <m>(x^4 - p)</m> are the following:

                        As <m>\frac{\sqrt[4]{p}i}{\sqrt[4]{p}}=i</m>, we see that <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{p})</m> is the splitting field of <m>F</m>. 
                        Note then that as <m>[\Q(i):\Q]=2</m> and the degree of the splitting field is 8, by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we see that the degree of the splitting field of <m>x^4-p</m> over <m>\Q(i)=4</m>. 
                        As <m>x^4-p</m> is monic and degree <m>4</m>, it must be the minimal polynomial of the second extension and thus irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>.

                  Assume <m>E</m> and <m>K</m> are both finite splitting fields over <m>\Q</m> and prove <m>E \cap K</m> is also a finite splitting field over <m>\Q</m>.

                  So there exist polynomials <m>f,g\in F[x]</m> such that <m>f</m> splits in <m>F</m> and <m>g</m> splits in <m>E</m>.

                  Let <m>F</m> be a field.

                        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> nilpotent matrix. 
                        Let <m>\lambda</m> be some eigenvalue of <m>A</m>. 
                        Thus there exists some vector <m>v</m> such that <m>A\lambda=\lambda v</m>. 
                        Let's consider this the base-case of some rather banal induction. 
                        Now assume that for <m>n</m> we have <m>A^nv=\lambda^nv</m>. Consider 
                        <me>A^{n+1}v=A(A^nv)=A(\lambda^n v)=\lambda^n(Av)=\lambda^{n+1}v.</me>
                        Recall that as <m>A</m> is nilpotent, there exists some <m>m\in\N</m> such that <m>A^m=0</m>. 
                        As <m>\lambda</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>, by the above induction we see that <m>\lambda^m</m> is an eigenvalue for <m>A^m=0</m>. 
                        As <m>F</m> is a field and thus an integral domain, we see that <m>\lambda^n=0</m> implies that <m>\lambda=0</m> is as well. 
                        As this holds in the algebraic closure of <m>F</m> as well, we see that when factored into linear terms all the <m>\lambda=0</m>. 
                        Thus <m>\cp_A(x)=x^n</m>.

                        By the Cayley Hamilton Theorem CITEX we know <m>\mp_A(x)|\cp_A(x)=x^n</m>, and thus <m>A^n=0</m>.

                        Assume <m>n \leq 3</m> and let <m>A,B</m> be nilpotent matrices with entries in <m>F</m>.

                      <p>
                        <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose <m>A\sim B</m>. 
                        Thus there exists some invertible matrix <m>P</m> such that <m>PAP\inv=B</m> by the definition of similar matrices. 
                        Let <m>U\in\ker(PA)</m>. 
                        Thus <m>PA(U)=0</m> and <m>P(AU)=0</m>. 
                        We multiply both sides by <m>P\inv</m> to see that <m>AU=0</m>. 
                        Therefore the <m>\ker(PA)=\ker(A)</m>, and hence the ranks of <m>PA</m> and <m>A</m> are equal by <xref text="title" ref="thm-rank-nullity"/>.

                        \end{aligned}</me>
                        as <m>(P^{-1})^T</m> is an invertible matrix. 
                        Thus <m>\rank(B)=\rank(PAP\inv)=\rank(A)</m>.

                      <p>
                        <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose that <m>\rank(A)=\rank(B)</m>. 
                        From Part (a) we know <m>\cp_A(x)=\cp_B(x)=x^n</m>.

                      <p>
                        We consider the case where <m>\cp_A(x)=\cp_B(x)=x^3</m>.
                      </p>
      
                      <p>
                        The only possible invariant factors involving <m>x^3</m> are 
                        1. <m>x,x,x</m>; 
                        2. <m>x,x^2</m>; and 
                        3. <m>x^3</m> itself. 
                        However, if <m>x,x,x</m> are the invariant factors then the rank of <m>A</m> would be 3, making it invertible, contradicting the fact that 0 is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>. 
                        Thus we need only consider the latter two cases.

                  Prove that <m>R[x]</m> is a PID if and only if <m>R</m> is a field.

              <solution>
                <p>
                  Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring and <m>x</m> an indeterminant.
                </p>

                <p>
                  First, suppose <m>R[x]</m> is a PID. 
                  Let <m>I</m> be a nonzero ideal in <m>R</m>, and consider the ideal <m>(I,x)\in R[x]</m>. 
                  As <m>R[x]</m> is a PID we see <m>(I,x)=(z)</m> for some <m>z\in R[x]</m>. 
                  Then <m>z|x</m>, but <m>x</m> is an indeterminant and thus irreducible, so <m>z</m> must be a unit or <m>x</m> itself. 
                  But <m>z</m> also generates <m>I</m>, so <m>z</m> can't be <m>x</m>, so <m>z</m> is a unit, meaning <m>z\in R</m> and so <m>I=(R)</m>. 
                  Thus the only ideals of <m>R</m> are <m>(0)</m> and <m>R</m>, making <m>R</m> a field.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Next, suppose <m>R</m> is a field. 
                  Let <m>J</m> be an ideal in <m>R[x]</m>. 
                  If <m>J\in R</m> then <m>J=R</m> or <m>J=(0)</m>, both of which are principal. 
                  Thus <m>x\in J</m>, and so <m>J=(x)</m>, making <m>J</m> principal as well. 
                  Hence <m>R[x]</m> is a PID.

                <p>
                  Recall that matrices are in the same conjugacy class if and only if they are similar, and that two matrices are similar if and only if they share the same invariant factors.

                <p>
                  Let <m>A\in\GL_2(\F_3)</m>. 
                  All characteristic polynomials are monic, and as <m>A</m> is invertible we see the <m>a_0</m> term in the <m>\cp_A(x)\neq0</m>, and thus <m>a_0</m> is either <m>1</m> or <m>2</m>, the only other elements in <m>\F_3</m>.
                  There are only so many monic polynomials of degree <m>2</m> with coefficients in <m>\F_3</m>; 
                  hence the only possible characteristic polynomials of <m>A</m> are the following: 
                  1. <m>f(x)=x^2+x+1</m>, 
                  2. <m>g(x)=x^2+x+2</m>, 
                  3. <m>h(x)=x^2+1</m>, 
                  4. <m>j(x)=x^2+2</m>. 
                  5. <m>k(x)=x^2+2x+1</m>. 
                  6. <m>\ell(x)=x^2+2x+2</m> 
                  Note that since <m>a_0\neq0</m>, 0 cannot be a root of any of these polynomials. 
                  Thus all that remains is to check <m>1</m> and <m>2</m>.

                  Observe <m>\widetilde{\phi}(xy)=hh'=\widetilde{\phi}(x)\widetilde{\phi}(y)</m>. 
                  Thus <m>\widetilde{\phi}</m> is a homomorphism, and for any <m>h\in H</m> we have <m>\widetilde{\phi}(h)=h</m>.

                  Suppose <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>5 \cdot 7 \cdot 23^2</m> and that <m>G</m> contains an element of order <m>35</m>. 
                  Prove <m>G</m> is abelian.

              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the number of Sylow <m>23</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m> must divide <m>35</m> and be congruent to <m>1\mod{23}</m>, the only option of which is <m>1</m>. 
                  Let <m>H</m> denote the unique Sylow <m>23</m>-subgroup and let <m>K</m> be the cyclic subgroup generated by the element of order <m>35</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As <m>H</m> is unique it is normal in <m>G</m>, and it also means we have <m>HK\leq G</m>. 
                  Notice that as <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> are groups of relatively prime order we have <m>H\cap K=\{e\}</m>. 
                  Thus <m>|HK|=|G|</m>, and so <m>G=HK</m>, making <m>G\cong H\times K</m>, a direct product of abelian groups. 
                  Thus <m>G</m> is abelian.

                        Thus it is the minimal polynomial of <m>\sqrt[4]{28}</m>, and so <m>F=\Q(\sqrt[4]{28})</m> is a field extension of <m>\Q</m> of degree <m>4</m>.

                  However, by the Factor Theorem CITEX the polynomial <m>x^k-1</m> can have at most <m>k</m> roots, and we have <m>n</m> distinct elements, and thus we have <m>k=n</m>.

                  Let <m>V</m> be a finite dimensional vector space over a field <m>F</m> and let <m>\t : V \to V</m> be an <m>F</m>-linear operator on <m>V</m>. 
                  Prove <m>\t</m> is diagonalizable over <m>F</m> if and only if its minimum polynomial <m>p(x)</m> factors into distinct linear terms in <m>F[x]</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose that <m>g</m> is diagonalizable. 
                  Thus there exists a change of basis matrix <m>A</m> such that <m>A</m> is diagonal. 
                  As it is diagonal, its diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of <m>g</m>, and thus the roots of the minimal polynomial of <m>g</m>. 
                  Using row and column operations we can rearrange <m>A</m> so that all repeated linear factors are next to each other in the diagonal, for convenience.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We know that <m>\mp_A(x)</m> is the smallest monic polynomial that sends <m>A</m> to <m>0</m>. 
                  Take all the distinct eigenvalues <m>\lambda_i</m> and consider <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We examine <m>q(A)</m>. 
                  It will be a product of matrices, one for each <m>\lambda_i</m>. 
                  First, take the first matrix in this product, <m>(A-\lambda_1I)</m>, and note that it sends all <m>\lambda_1</m> in <m>A</m> to 0. 
                  Thus all of the rows and columns that contained a <m>\lambda_1</m> are now 0, and thus all these rows and columns will be 0 in the final product <m>q(A)</m>. 
                  As this is we set <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m> for all <m>l\lambda_i\in A</m>, we see that for each row and column in <m>A</m> there will exist a matrix <m>A-\lambda_iI</m> in the product <m>q(A)</m> such that the row and column will be 0. 
                  Thus the entire matrix will be 0, and <m>q(A)=0</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Note that if any <m>\lambda_i</m> were excluded from <m>q(x)</m> there would exist a non-zero row and column for every matrix in the product, and thus <m>q</m> would not send <m>A</m> to 0. 
                  Thus <m>q(x)</m> is indeed the minimal polynomial of <m>A</m>. 
                  As <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m>, we see it does indeed factor into distinct linear terms.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose the minimum polynomial of <m>g</m> factors completely into distinct linear factors, each of which has the form <m>x-\lambda_i</m> for some <m>\lambda_i\in F</m>. 
                  As each <m>\lambda_i</m> is distinct, each elementary divisor is of the form <m>(x-\lambda_i)^1</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We construct the Jordan Canonical Form of <m>g</m>. As the elementary divisors are linear the Jordan blocks are <m>1\times1</m> matrices, making the <m>JCF</m> a diagonal matrix. 
                  As the JCF is itself a change of basis matrix, we see that <m>g</m> is diagonalizable.

                  We also know <m>n_7|55</m> and <m>n_7\equiv 1\mod{7}</m>, so <m>n_7=1</m> as well.

                  Let <m>P</m> denote the unique Sylow <m>7</m>-subgroup, and let <m>G</m> act on <m>P</m> by conjugation.

                  However, by <xref provisional="cite"/> we know <m>\Aut(P)=\Z_{7}^\times=\Z_6</m>, meaning that the order of <m>K</m> must divide both <m>385</m> and <m>6</m> by <xref provisional="cite"/>, CITEX which cannot happen.

                  Additionally, as <m>f</m> is the minimal polynomial of <m>\a</m> it is irreducible, making the action transitive as well.

                  Let <m>k</m> denote the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m>. 
                  Notice that as <m>g^n=1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m> we have <m>k\leq n</m>.

                <p>
                  However, as <m>g^k=1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m> we know that <m>g</m> is the root of the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^k-1</m> in <m>F[x]</m>. 
                  By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-factor-thm"/> there are thus at most <m>k</m> roots of <m>f</m>, but there are <m>n</m> distinct roots.

                <p>
                  Let <m>L</m> be the algebraic closure of <m>F</m>. 
                  Thus <m>A</m> has a Jordan Canonical Form in <m>L</m>. 
                  For each Jordan block <m>J_i</m> in the JCF of <m>A</m>, let <m>B_i</m> denote the transpose of the identity matrix, and notice that <m>B_iJ_iB_i\inv=J_i^T</m>. 
                  As this is the case for every Jordan block, we see that the JCF of <m>A</m>, <m>J</m>, is similar to its transpose. 
                  As the <m>A</m> is similar to <m>J</m>, <m>A^T</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, and <m>J</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, we see that <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>L</m> by transitivity.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Suppose <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m>. 
                  As <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have entries in <m>F</m>, then they are both in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>.

                  However, <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m> as well. 
                  Notice <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are still in RCF. 
                  However, as the RCF is unique, this means that <m>C=D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m>, making them equal in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> as well. 
                  Thus <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m>, as similarity is transitive.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This yields <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>F</m>.

                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a (not necessarily finite) group and <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> normal subgroups such that <m>G = HK</m>. 
                  Prove that <m>G/(H\cap K)\cong G/H \times G/K</m>.

                  Let <m>f:G\to G/H\times G/K</m> defined such that <m>f(g)=(gH, gK)</m>. 
                  Let <m>x,y\in G</m>. 
                  Then <me>f(xy)=(xyH,xyK)=(xHyH,xKyK)=(xH,yH)\cdot(xKyK)=f(x)f(y),</me> showing <m>f</m> is a homomorphism.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let <m>(xH,yK)\in G/H\times G/K</m>. 
                  As <m>x,y\in G=HK</m>, we have <m>x=hk</m> and <m>y=h'k'</m> with <m>h,h'\in H</m> and <m>k,k'\in K</m>. 
                  As <m>k'\in K</m> and <m>h\in H</m> we see <m>(xH,yK)=(kH,h'K)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Consider <m>g=kh'\in G</m> and

                  Let <m>g\in H\cap K</m>.

                  Then <m>f(g)=(H,K)</m>, so <m>gH=H</m> and <m>gK=K</m>, placing <m>g\in H\cap K</m>. 
                  Thus, by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/>, we have <m>G/(H\cap K)\cong G/H \times G/K.</m>

            <activity><title>Problem 2</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Suppose <m>G</m> is a finite group which has precisely one subgroup of order <m>d</m> for each divisor <m>d</m> of <m>|G|</m>. 
                  Prove that <m>G</m> is cyclic.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  First, suppose that <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group. 
                  Let <m>g\in G</m> have biggest order. 
                  Let <m>h\in G</m>. 
                  So <m>|h|\bigg||g|</m>. 
                  Since <m>(g)\leq G</m>, it also has exactly one subgroup for each divisor. 
                  But (h) has the same order as one of those subgroups, so they must be the same group. 
                  So <m>h\in(g)</m>. 
                  Since <m>h</m> was arbitrary, then <m>G\leq (g)</m>. 
                  So when <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group then it is cyclic.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If its not a <m>p</m>-group then we can decompose <m>|G|</m> into relatively prime powers of primes, all of which are <m>p</m>-groups and maintain this property. 
                  Thus <m>G</m> is the product of relatively prime cyclic groups, making it cyclic itself.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>90 = 2 Â· 3^2 Â· 5</m> and let <m>\Syl_3(G)</m> denote the set of Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m>.

                        Suppose for any <m>Q, Q' \in \Syl_3(G)</m> either <m>Q = Q'</m> or <m>Q \cap Q' = {1}.</m> 
                        Prove that <m>G</m> is not simple.

                        Suppose there exists <m>Q, Q' â \Syl_3(G)</m> such that <m>|Q \cap Q'| = 3</m>. 
                        Prove that <m>G</m> is not simple. (Hint: Consider the normalizer of <m>Q \cap Q'</m>.)
                      </p>

                  </ol>
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>90 = 2 Â· 3^2 Â· 5</m> and let <m>\Syl_3(G)</m> denote the set of Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m>. 
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> is simple. 
                        By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the following: 
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              <m>n_3|10</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod{3}</m>. 
                              As <m>G</m> is simple there must be ten of them. 
                            </p>
                          </li>

                          <li>
                            <p>
                              <m>n_5|18</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod 5</m>. 
                              As <m>G</m> is simple there must be six of them. 
                            </p>
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        Since each Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup will have <m>3^2-1=8</m> non-identity elements and they are all distinct that accounts for <m>80</m> elements of order <m>3</m>. 
                        However, there are also <m>24</m> elements or order <m>5</m> to account for, which is a problem. 
                        Thus <m>G</m> cannot be simple.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Suppose now that there exists <m>Q, Q' â \Syl_3(G)</m> such that <m>|Q \cap Q'| = 3</m>. 
                        Given this intersection, we know that <m>|QQ'|=9\cdot 9/3=27</m>. 
                        Additionally, note that as <m>Q \cap Q'</m> is a subgroup of both <m>Q</m> and <m>Q'</m> with index 3 in both, the smallest prime dividing the order or both, that <m>Q \cap Q'</m> is normal in both.
                      </p>
      
                      <p>
                        We now consider the normalizer of <m>Q \cap Q'</m>, which we denote <m>N</m> for simplicity. 
                        As <m>N</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> its order must divide <m>90</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>. 
                        However, <m>QQ'\leq N</m>, and so <m>N</m> must have at least <m>27</m> elements, leaving the options of <m>45</m> and <m>90</m>. 
                        If <m>|N|=90</m> then <m>N=G</m>, making <m>Q\cap Q'</m> normal in <m>G</m>, a problem.
                      </p>
      
                      <p>
                        If <m>|N|=45</m> then <m>[G:N]=2</m>, the smallest prime dividing <m>G</m>. 
                        Thus <m>N</m> is still normal, which is still a problem. 
                        Thus <m>G</m> cannot be simple.

                <p>
                  Let <m>F</m> be a field of characteristic <m>p &gt; 0</m>, <m>a \in F</m>, and consider the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^p -x-a \in F[x]</m>.
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Suppose <m>f</m> has a root, <m>\alpha</m>, in <m>F</m>. 
                        Then <m>\alpha^p-\alpha-a=0</m>. 
                        Consider <m>\alpha+j</m> for some <m>j\in\Z/p</m>, and observe <m>(\alpha+j)^p-(\alpha+j)-a</m>. 
                        By The Freshman's Dream, we have <m>\alpha^p+j^p-\alpha-j-a</m>, but as <m>\alpha^p-\alpha-a=0</m>, we really have <m>j^p-j</m>. 
                        By Fermat's Little Theorem, <m>p|j^p-j</m>, and thus <m>f(\alpha+j)=0</m>. 
                        Thus we have found <m>p</m> roots of <m>f</m>, and thus <m>f</m> splits into linear factors.
                      </p>
      
                      <p>
                        Suppose then that no root of <m>f</m> exists in <m>F</m>. 
                        Let <m>L</m> be a splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>F</m>, and note that from the above paragraph we have <m>L=F(\alpha)</m>. 
                        As <m>f'(x)=1</m>, we see <m>\gcd(f,f')=1</m>, and thus <m>f</m> is separable. 
                        Hence <m>F(\alpha)</m> is a Galois extension. 
                        Thus there exists a <m>\sigma\in\Gal(L/F)</m> such that <m>\sigma(\alpha)\neq\alpha</m>. 
                        So <m>\sigma(\alpha)=\alpha+j</m> for some <m>j\in\Z/p</m>. 
                        Notice <m>\sigma(\alpha+j)=\sigma(\alpha)+j=\alpha+2j</m>. 
                        As <m>p</m> is prime, we see that <m>|j|=p</m>, and thus we need to apply <m>\sigma</m> to <m>\alpha</m> <m>p</m> times in order to get back to <m>\alpha</m>. 
                        Thus <m>\sigma(\alpha)^p=\alpha</m>, so <m>|\sigma|=p</m>. 
                        Thus <m>|\Gal(L/F)|=p</m>. 
                        Thus the minimum polynomial of <m>\alpha</m> must have degree <m>p</m>. 
                        As <m>\alpha</m> is a root of <m>f</m> and <m>f</m> is monic, it must be the minimal polynomial and is thus irreducible.

                        Suppose <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>F</m> and let <m>L</m> be a splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>F</m>. 
                        Let <m>\alpha</m> be a root of <m>f.</m> 
                        Consider <m>F(\alpha)</m>. 
                        By part (a), <m>F(\alpha)</m> contains all the roots of <m>f</m>, hence <m>L=F(\alpha)</m>.
                        As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible, it is the minimum polynomial of <m>f</m>, and thus <m>[L:F]=p</m>.
                        Hence <m>|\Gal(L/F)|=p</m>. 
                        All groups of prime order are cyclic, completing the proof.

            <activity><title>Problem 1</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Prove that any group of order <m>36</m> has a normal subgroup of order <m>3</m> or <m>9</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>36=2^2\cdot 3^2</m>. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we have <m>n_3|4</m> and <m>n_3\equiv 1\mod{3}</m>, and thus <m>n_3=1,4</m>. 
                  If <m>n_3=1</m> then the unique Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup is normal by <xref ref="cor-unique-sylow-normal"/>, giving us a normal subgroup of order <m>9</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Suppose then that <m>n_3=4</m>, let <m>P</m> be one of the subgroups of order <m>9</m>, and let <m>G</m> act on the cosets of <m>H</m> by left multiplication, inducing the homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to S_4</m> via the <xref text="title" ref="thm-permrep"/>.
                  This is because there are <m>9</m> elements in <m>P</m>, and thus there are <m>4</m> left cosets by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As <m>|S_4|=24&lt;36=|G|</m>, we see that <m>\rho</m> cannot be injective by <xref provisional="cite"/> and thus <m>N=\ker(\rho)</m> is a non-trivial normal subgroup of <m>G</m> by <xref provisional="cite"/>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Recall that the action of <m>G</m> on its cosets by left multiplication is always a transitive action <xref provisional="cite"/>, meaning there is exactly one orbit, <m>\Orb(sP)</m>, for some <m>sP\in G/P</m>, which must then have all <m>4</m> elements of <m>G/P</m> in it. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/>, <m>|G|=|\Orb(sP)|\cdot|\Stab(sP)|</m>, and thus <m>|\Stab(s)|=9</m>. 
                  So there are <m>9</m> elements in <m>G</m> that fix <m>s</m> for any <m>sP\in G/P</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let <m>xP \in G/P</m> and <m>g\in N</m>. 
                  Notice that <m>g\cdot xP=gxP</m>. 
                  As <m>g\in N</m>, we know that <m>\rho(g)</m> yields the identity permutation, and thus that <m>gxP=xP</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Thus <m>N\subseteq\Stab(xP)</m>, which has order 9.

                        Let <m>f:G/H\to gHg\inv</m> be defined by <m>f(gH)=gHg\inv</m>. Suppose <m>xH=yH</m>. Notice that <m>f(xH)=xHx\inv</m> and <m>f(H)=yHy\inv</m>, but as <m>x=y</m> we have equality, and thus <m>f</m> is well defined. Let <m>gHg\inv</m> be a conjugate set, and let <m>gH\in G/H</m>. Then <m>f(gH)=gHg\inv</m>, and so we have surjectivity. As <m>|G/H|=|[G:H]|=h</m>, there can be at most <m>h</m> distinct conjugate sets for <m>g\in G</m>.

However, under this action the orbits are exactly the conjugacy classes of <m>H</m> by <xref provisional="cite"/>. There are at most <m>h</m> conjugacy classes. Each conjugacy class has at most <m>|H|</m> elements in it, and each one has the identity. As there are at most <m>h</m> of them then when we add all of their orders we get at most <m>h(|H|-1)</m>, which is less than the order of <m>G</m>.

                  Let <m>p</m> be an odd prime, <m>G</m> a group of order <m>p(p+1)</m>, and <m>P</m> a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m> that is not normal in <m>P</m>.

                      <p>
                        First, by <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we see that <m>n_p=p+1</m>. 
                        So there are <m>(p-1)(p+1)=p^2-1</m> elements of order <m>p</m>, and <m>|G|=p^2+p</m>. 
                        So there are <m>p+1</m> elements left.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Also from <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know <m>G</m> acts on <m>\Syl_p(G)</m> by conjugation. 
                        The normalizer of <m>P</m> is the set <m>N_G(P)=\{g\in G|gPg\inv=P\}</m>, which is exactly the stabilizer of <m>P</m> under this action by <xref provisional="cite"/>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Let <m>x\in P</m>, and observe <m>xPx\inv=P</m>, so <m>x\in N_G(P)</m>, and <m>P\subseteq N_G(P)</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The conjugation action on Sylow subgroups is transitive by Part (2) of <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>, and thus there is exactly one orbit under this action by <xref provisional="cite"/>. 
                        By <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/> we have <m>|G|=|\Orb(x)|\cdot|\Stab(x)|</m>, and thus <m>|\Stab(x)|=p+1</m> for every <m>x\in P</m>. 
                        However, <m>p</m> of these elements are accounted for by <m>P</m> and the last element is the identity, thus the only elements of <m>N_G(P)</m> are those in <m>P</m>.

                        Let <m>P=\langle t\rangle</m>, <m>a</m> be an element of order <m>2</m> in <m>G</m>, and <m>n&lt;,m\leq p-1</m>. 
                        Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>t^nat^{-n}=t^mat^{-m}</m>. 
                        By strategic multiplication we see <m>a=t^kat^{-k}</m>, where <m>k=m-n</m>. 
                        Thus we can reduce to the case where As <m>a=t^kat^{-k}</m> for some<m>k\leq p-1</m>.

                      <p>
                        As <m>a</m> has order two, it is contained in some Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. 
                        Since <m>P=\langle t\rangle</m> we have <m>t^k=x</m> for some <m>x\in P</m>. 
                        Notice then that <m>a=xax\inv</m> means that <m>x=axa\inv</m>, placing <m>a\in N_G(x)</m>, contradicting the fact that <m>a\not\in P</m>, as it does not have order <m>3</m>. 
                        Thus <m>a</m> is distinct from <m>t^kat^{-k}</m> for all <m>k\leq p-1</m>.

                        Let <m>G</m> be a finite subgroup of <m>F^*</m>. Let <m>|G|=n</m>.

                      <p>
                        Let <m>k</m> be the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m>. 
                        Then <m>g^k=1</m> and thus <m>g</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^k-1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. 
                        By <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> every element divides <m>n</m>, and so we have <m>k\leq n</m>. 
                        However, by the Factor Theorem CITEX the polynomial <m>x^k-1</m> can have at most <m>k</m> roots, and we have <m>n</m> distinct elements, and thus we have <m>k=n</m>. 
                        Thus there must exist an element of order <m>n</m> in <m>G</m>, making <m>G</m> cyclic, as desired.

                        Let <m>n\in\N</m> and suppose that <m>F</m> has characteristic <m>p&gt;0</m> and is algebraically closed.

                        First, suppose by way of contradiction that <m>F^*</m> has a subgroup of order <m>n</m>, <m>G</m>, and <m>p|n</m>. 
                        From Part (a) <m>G</m> is cyclic and generated by some <m>x</m> such that <m>|x|=n</m>. 
                        However, as <m>p|n</m> we see that <m>x^p=0</m>, given that we are in an additive group. 
                        This contradicts the fact that <m>n</m> is the smallest number such that <m>x^n=0</m>.
                      </p>
          
                      <p>
                        Now we proceed via the contrapositive. 
                        Suppose <m>F^*</m> does not have a subgroup of order <m>n</m>. 
                        Then there cannot exist a unit <m>x</m> such that <m>|x|=n</m>. 
                        Consider the polynomial <m>x^n-1</m>. As <m>F</m> is algebraically closed there exists some root <m>r\in F</m>. 
                        (how do we know this isn't 1???) 
                        Notice that this means <m>r^n=1</m> and so <m>r</m> is a unit in <m>F</m>. 
                        As <m>r</m> cannot have order <m>n</m>, it must have an order that divides <m>n</m>. 
                        We also know that <m>r^p=1</m> as we are in a field of characteristic <m>p</m>. 
                        Thus <m>|r|</m> either divides <m>p</m> or is <m>p</m>. 
                        Either there is a non-identity root of <m>x^n-1=(x-1)^n</m>.
                        Note that in this case <m>n&gt;p</m> as we are

                  So there's that done.

                  Suppose by way of contradiction there exist <m>\a,\b</m> such that <m>2=\a\b</m>. 
                  Then <m>\a=a+b\sqrt{-5}</m> and <m>\b=c+d\sqrt{-5}</m>, and

                    N(2)=4=N(\a\b)=N(\a)N(\b)=(a^2+5b^2)(c^2+5d^2).
                  </me> 
                  Thus <m>(a^2+5b^2)=\pm1,\pm2,</m> or <m>\pm4</m>, as these are the only integer divisors of <m>4</m>. 
                  However, there do not exist integers <m>a,b</m> such that this is true. 
                  Thus <m>2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>.

                  Thus <m>2a+2b\sqrt{-5}=1\pm\sqrt{-5}</m>, and so <m>2a=\pm1</m>. 
                  However, <m>\pm\frac12</m> is not an integer, and thus <m>2</m> cannot divide either of these factors. 
                  Thus <m>2</m> is not prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>. 
                  By Part (a), this is not a UFD.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>A</m> a square matrix with entries from <m>F</m>. 
                  Prove that <m>A</m> is similar to its transpose.
                </p>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  Let <m>L</m> be the algebraic closure of <m>F</m>. 
                  Thus <m>A</m> has a Jordan Canonical Form in <m>L</m>. 
                  For each Jordan block <m>J_i</m> in the JCF of <m>A</m>, let <m>B_i</m> denote the transpose of the identity matrix, and notice that <m>B_iJ_iB_i\inv=J_i^T</m>. 
                  As this is the case for every Jordan block, we see that the JCF of <m>A</m>, <m>J</m>, is similar to its transpose. 
                  As the <m>A</m> is similar to <m>J</m>, <m>A^T</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, and <m>J</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, we see that <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>L</m> by transitivity.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Suppose <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m>. 
                  As <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have entries in <m>F</m>, then they are both in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>. 
                  Thus there exist matrices <m>C,D\in\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> in RCF such that <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m>. 
                  However, <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m> as well. 
                  Notice <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are still in RCF. 
                  However, as the RCF is unique, this means that <m>C=D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m>, making them equal in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> as well. 
                  Thus <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m>, as similarity is transitive.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This yields <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>F</m>. # Jan 15

                        Let <m>G</m> act on <m>P</m> by conjugation. 
                        This gives rise to the <xref text="title" ref="thm-permrep"/> homomorphism <m>\rho: G\to S_{11}</m>. 
                        However, <m>P</m> has prime order, making it a cyclic group isomorphic to <m>\Z_{11}</m>.

                        By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/> we know that <m>G/\ker(\rho)\cong\im(\rho)=\Aut(P)</m>. 
                        However, <m>\Aut(P)\cong\Aut(\Z_{11})\cong \Z^x</m>, which has order <m>10</m>. 
                        As this is a homomorphism, we see the order of <m>G/\ker(\rho)</m> must divide both <m>10</m> and <m>231</m>, two numbers that are relatively prime. 
                        Thus <m>\ker(\rho)=1</m>, meaning that conjugation is equivalent to the identity map, or that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>.

                  Let <m>G</m> be a finite <m>p</m>-group and <m>Z</m> its center. 
                  If <m>N\neq \{e\}</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, prove that <m>N\cap Z\neq\{e\}</m>.

                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a finite <m>p</m>-group for some prime <m>p</m> and <m>N\neq {1}</m> a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  First, we show that the center of <m>G</m> is nontrivial. 
                  (See: [[Modern Algebra#Corollary â Center of <m>p</m>-group is Nontrivial|Corollary]]) 
                  Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>Z(G)=\{e\}</m>. 
                  We examine the conjugacy classes of <m>G</m>. 
                  From the <xref text="title" ref="thm-class-eq"/>, we know
                  <me>
                    |G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|.
                  </me>
                  Note that <m>|G|=p^n</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>, meaning that the only divisors of <m>|G|</m> are powers of <m>p</m>. 
                  In finite groups, each conjugacy class must divide the order of the group. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>, <m>|G : C_G(g_i)|=\frac{|G|}{|C_G(g_i)|}=\frac{p^n}{p^m}=p^k</m>, where <m>m,k\in\N</m>. 
                  Since <m>|Z(G)|=1</m>, we see that <m>\sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|\bigg|p^n-1</m>, which is impossible given that <m>p^n-1 \not|p^n</m>. 
                  Thus <m>Z(G)\neq\{e\}</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As <m>N\nsg G</m> it is a union of conjugacy classes of the elements it contains, one of which is <m>e</m>. 
                  Assume by way of contradiction that <m>N\cap Z(G)={e}</m>, meaning that <m>e</m> is the only element in <m>N</m> whose conjugacy class is a singleton. 
                  This yields 
                  <me>
                    |N| = 1+ \sum_i^r |G : C_G(n_i)|.
                  </me> 
                  However, by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> <m>N</m> must also be a <m>p-</m>group, and thus by an analogous element counting argument as above we see that there exists some <m>x\in N</m> such that <m>C_G(x)=\{x\}</m>, or that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. 
                  Thankfully, this means that <m>x\in Z(G)</m>, and thus we have <m>Z(G)\cap N\neq 1</m>.

                      Prove that <m>T</m> is a maximal linearly independent subset if and only if <m>M/N</m> is torsion. 
                      (Recall that an <m>R</m>-module <m>P</m> is called âtorsion'' if for each <m>p \in P</m>, there is a <m>r \in R</m> such that <m>r \ne 0</m> and <m>rp = 0</m>.)

                      <p>
                        Let <m>A</m> be the set of all linearly independent subsets of <m>M</m> that contain <m>T</m>. 
                        We can order <m>A</m> with respect to inclusion. 
                        Let <m>X</m> be a totally ordered subset of <m>A</m>, and let <m>U</m> be the union of all elements in <m>X</m>. 
                        Let <m>\{u_i\}</m> be a set of elements in <m>U</m> such that <m>\sum_{i=0}^nr_iu_i=0</m> for some <m>r_i\in R</m>, where <m>i\leq n</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>. 
                        As <m>U</m> is the union of all elements in <m>X</m>, there exists some <m>B_1</m> such that <m>u_1\in B_1</m>. 
                        However, as <m>X</m> is totally ordered, there exists some <m>B_2</m> such that <m>B_2</m> contains <m>B_1</m> and <m>u_2\in B_2</m>. 
                        Continuing in this way, we see that there exists some <m>B_n\in X</m> such that <m>\{u_i\}\subseteq B_n</m>. 
                        As <m>B_n</m> is linearly independent, we know that <m>\sum_{i=0}^nr_iu_i=0</m> means that <m>r_i=0</m> for all <m>i</m>. 
                        Thus <m>U</m> is indeed linearly independent, making it an upper bound for <m>X</m>. 
                        Thus by <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/> there exists a maximal element of <m>A</m>, which we denote <m>S</m>.

                        Let <m>x\neq0\in M</m> and consider <m>T\cup\{x\}</m>. 
                        Consider <m>x+N\in M/N</m>. 
                        As <m>M/N</m> is torsion, there exists an <m>r\neq0\in R</m> such that <m>rxN=0</m>. 
                        Thus <m>rx\in N</m>. 
                        (Note, if <m>x\in N</m>, then <m>r=1</m>). 
                        As <m>rx\in N</m> and <m>N</m> is generated by <m>T</m> (<m>N=RT</m>), <m>rx=\sum r_it_i</m>. 
                        Subtracting over we see that <m>rx-\sum r_it_i=0</m>. 
                        But as <m>r\neq 0</m>, we see that each <m>t_i</m> and <m>x</m> are in <m>T\cup\{x\}</m>, but the sum is 0. 
                        Thus <m>T\cup\{x\}</m> is linearly dependent.

                  Suppose <m>G</m> is a finite group which has precisely one subgroup of order <m>d</m> for each divisor <m>d</m> of <m>|G|</m>. 
                  Prove that <m>G</m> is cyclic.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  First, suppose that <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group. 
                  Let <m>g\in G</m> have biggest order. Let <m>h\in G</m>. 
                  So <m>|h|\bigg||g|</m>. 
                  Since <m>(g)\leq G</m>, it also has exactly one subgroup for each divisor. 
                  But <m>(h)</m> has the same order as one of those subgroups, so they must be the same group. 
                  So <m>h\in(g)</m>. 
                  Since <m>h</m> was arbitrary, then <m>G\leq (g)</m>. 
                  So when <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group then it is cyclic.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If its not a <m>p</m>-group then we can decompose <m>|G|</m> into relatively prime powers of primes, all of which are <m>p</m>-groups and maintain this property. 
                  Thus <m>G</m> is the product of relatively prime cyclic groups, making it cyclic itself.

                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>90 = 2 Â· 3^2 Â· 5</m> and let <m>\Syl_3(G)</m> denote the set of Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m>.

                        Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> is simple. 
                        By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the following:
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              <m>n_3|10</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod{3}</m>. As <m>G</m> is simple there must be ten. 
                            </p>
                          </li>

                          <li>
                            <p>
                              <m>n_5|18</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod 5</m>. As <m>G</m> is simple there must be six.

                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        Since each Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup will have <m>3^2-1=8</m> non-identity elements and they are all distinct that accounts for <m>80</m> elements of order <m>3</m>. 
                        However, there are also <m>24</m> elements or order <m>5</m> to account for, which is a problem. 
                        Thus <m>G</m> cannot be simple.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                      <p>
                        Suppose now that there exists <m>Q, Q' \in \Syl_3(G)</m> such that <m>|Q \cap Q'| = 3</m>. 
                        Given this intersection, we know that <m>|QQ'|=9\cdot 9/3=27</m>. 
                        Additionally, note that as <m>Q \cap Q'</m> is a subgroup of both <m>Q</m> and <m>Q'</m> with index <m>3</m>.
                        Since this is the smallest prime dividing the order of both <m>Q</m> and <m>Q'</m>, by <xref ref="thm-smallest-prime-normal"/> we see that <m>Q \cap Q'</m> is normal in both.
                      </p>
                      
                      <p>
                        We now consider the normalizer of <m>Q \cap Q'</m>, which we denote <m>N</m> for simplicity. 
                        As <m>N</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> its order must divide <m>90</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>. 
                        However, <m>QQ'\leq N</m>, and so <m>N</m> must have at least <m>27</m> elements, leaving the options of <m>45</m> and <m>90</m>. 
                        If <m>|N|=90</m> then <m>N=G</m>, making <m>Q\cap Q'</m> normal in <m>G</m>, a problem.

                      <p>
                        If <m>|N|=45</m> then <m>[G:N]=2</m>, the smallest prime dividing <m>G</m>. 
                        Thus <m>N</m> is still normal by <xref ref="thm-smallest-prime-normal"/>, which is still a problem.

                  Let <m>F</m> be a field of characteristic <m>p &gt; 0</m>, <m>a \in F</m>, and consider the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^p -x-a \in F[x]</m>.

                        Then <m>\alpha^p-\alpha-a=0</m>. 
                        Consider <m>\alpha+j</m> for some <m>j\in\Z/p</m>, and observe <m>(\alpha+j)^p-(\alpha+j)-a</m>. 
                        By The Freshman's Dream, CITEX we have <m>\alpha^p+j^p-\alpha-j-a</m>, but as <m>\alpha^p-\alpha-a=0</m>, we really have <m>j^p-j</m>. 
                        By Fermat's Little Theorem, CITEX <m>p|j^p-j</m>, and thus <m>f(\alpha+j)=0</m>. 
                        Thus we have found <m>p</m> roots of <m>f</m>, and thus <m>f</m> splits into linear factors.

                        Let <m>\alpha</m> be a root of <m>f</m>.
                        Consider <m>F(\alpha)</m>. 
                        By part (1), <m>F(\alpha)</m> contains all the roots of <m>f</m>, hence <m>L=F(\alpha)</m>. 
                        As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible, it is the minimum polynomial of <m>f</m>, and thus <m>[L:F]=p</m>. 
                        Hence <m>|\Gal(L/F)|=p</m>. 
                        All groups of prime order are cyclic CITEX, completing the proof.

                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>150</m> and suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> is simple. 
                  Notice that <m>150=2\cdot 3\cdot 5^2</m>. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>, we know <m>|\Syl_5(G)|\equiv 1\mod{5}</m> and divides <m>6</m>, the only options are thus <m>1</m> and <m>6</m>. 
                  Since <m>G</m> is simple, there must be exactly <m>n_5=6</m>, where <m>n_5=\Syl_5(G)</m>. 
                  Let <m>G</m> act on <m>\Syl_5(G)</m> by conjugation. 
                  Thus <m>\rho: G\to S_6</m> is a group homomorphism. 
                  Note that <m>|S_6|=720</m>, and that the order of <m>G</m> does not divide <m>720</m>. 
                  By Part (2) of <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> this action is transitive, meaning that the kernel of <m>\rho</m> cannot be trivial. 
                  Thus <m>\ker(\rho)</m> is a nontrivial normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, a contradiction. 
                  Thus no group of order <m>150</m> is simple.

                        The <xref text="title" ref="thm-sit-group"/> also tells us that <m>HN\leq G</m>.

                        Let <m>r,s\in N</m>. 
                        Then <m>r^n=0</m> and <m>s^m=0</m> for <m>n,m\in\N</m>. 
                        Consider <m>(r+s)^{mn}</m>, which, by the binomial theorem, has each term raised to either the <m>n</m>th or <m>m</m>th power, sending the whole thing to <m>0</m>.

                        Additionally, if <m>r\in N</m> consider <m>r\inv=-r</m> when viewed as an additive group. 
                        Notice <m>-r^{2n}=r(2n)=0</m>. 
                        Finally, let <m>x\not\in N</m> and consider <m>(rx)^n=r^nx^n=0</m>, so <m>rx\in N</m>.

                        This means there exists some <m>m\in\N</m> such that <m>r^{n^m}=r^{nm}=0</m>, placing <m>r\in N</m>. 
                        Thus all nilpotent elements in <m>R/N</m> are actually <m>0</m> (possibly four <m>0</m>'s in a trench coat).

                      <p>
                        First, suppose <m>f</m> is a nilpotent element of <m>R[x]</m>. 
                        Thus <m>f^n=0</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>. 
                        By the binomial shenanigans every product of coefficients must to go <m>0</m>.

                      <p>
                        Next, suppose every coefficient of <m>f</m> is nilpotent. 
                        Let <m>n</m> be equal to the product of all the smallest powers that send each coefficient to <m>0</m>. 
                        Thus by more binomial shenanigans we have <m>f^n=0</m>.

                  Prove the following statements about matrices <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> with entries in <m>F</m>:

                        Suppose <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(K)</m>. 
                        As <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have entries in <m>F</m>, then they are both in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>. 
                        Thus there exist matrices <m>C,D\in\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> in RCF such that <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m>. 
                        However, <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(K)</m> as well. 
                        Notice <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are still in RCF. 
                        However, as the RCF is unique, this means that <m>C=D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(K)</m>, making them equal in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> as well. 
                        Thus <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m>, as similarity is transitive.

                        Thus <m>A</m> has a Jordan Canonical Form in <m>L</m>. 
                        For each Jordan block <m>J_i</m> in the JCF of <m>A</m>, let <m>B_i</m> denote the transpose of the identity matrix, and notice that <m>B_iJ_iB_i\inv=J_i^T</m>. 
                        As this is the case for every Jordan block, we see that the JCF of <m>A</m>, <m>J</m>, is similar to its transpose. 
                        As the <m>A</m> is similar to <m>J</m>, <m>A^T</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, and <m>J</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, we see that <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>L</m> by transitivity. 
                        From the first part of this problem, this yields <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>F</m>.

                  Let <m>I</m> be a maximal ideal in <m>R</m>. 
                  Thus <m>R/I</m> is a field. 
                  Lemma 1.58 CITEX tells us that <m>M/IM</m> and <m>N/IN</m> are <m>R/I</m>-vector spaces. 
                  Additionally, this gives rise to <m>\overline{p}:M/IM\to N/IN</m>, which is a surjective <m>R/I</m>-module linear transformation.

                <p>
                  Note that <m>M</m> is generated by <m>e_i+IM</m> for <m>i\leq m</m>. 
                  Let <m>a_i\in R</m> and consider <m>\sum a_ie_i=0</m>. 
                  For this to be <m>0</m> we need it to be in <m>IM</m>, and thus all <m>a_i\in I</m>. 
                  So the set of <m>e_i</m> is a basis for <m>M/IM</m> with <m>m</m> elements. 
                  Likewise <m>N/IN</m> has a basis with <m>n</m> elements. 
                  As we are surjective, <m>\Rank=n</m>, <m>\dim=m</m>. 
                  So by CITEX Rank-Nullity <m>\dim(\ker)=m-n</m> which is only positive with <m>m\geq n</m>.

                        First, notice that <m>A</m> is upwards triangular, and thus <m>\cp_A(x)=(x-3)^4</m>. 
                        By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-cayley-hamilton-thm"/> the minimum polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial, and from the definition of minimum polynomial we know <m>\mp_A(x)</m> is the smallest polynomial such that <m>\mp_A(A) = 0</m>. 
                        Since <m>\mp_A(x)</m> must be a power of <m>(x-3)^n</m> with <m>n\leq 4</m>, we plug in values of <m>n</m> until we get <m>0</m>. 
                        <me>
                          (A-3I)^1=\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\ \end{bmatrix}
                        </me> 
                        Shucks. 
                        Moving on, 
                        <me>
                          (A-3I)^2=\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\ \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\ \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ \end{bmatrix},
                        </me>
                        which is also not <m>0</m>. 
                        However, multiplying one more time we see <m>\mp_A(x)=(x-3)^3</m>. 
                        By part (2) of the <xref text="title" ref="thm-cayley-hamilton-thm"/> <m>(x-3)^3</m> is an invariant factor. 
                        By part (1) of that same theorem, invariant factors must multiply to <m>\cp_A(x)</m>, and so the invariant factors are <m>x-3</m> and <m>(x-3)^3</m>. 
                        These are also the elementary divisors. 
                        So

                        </me> 
                        And notice that <m>(B-3I)^2=0</m>. 
                        Thus <m>(x-3)^3</m> cannot be the minimal polynomial of <m>B</m>.
                        Two matrices are only similar if they share the same invariant factors (and thus the same minimum polynomial), so <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are not similar.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>V</m> a vector space (not necessarily finite-dimensional) over <m>F</m>. 
                  Prove that every linearly independent subset of <m>V</m> is contained in a basis for <m>V</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  Let <m>I</m> be linearly independent in <m>V</m>. 
                  Add elements to it until it spans <m>V</m>, and denote this new set <m>S</m>. 
                  Let <m>\cP</m> denote the collection of all subsets <m>X</m> of <m>V</m> such that <m>I\subseteq X \subseteq S</m> and <m>X</m> is linearly independent. 
                  We make <m>\cP</m> into a poset by the order relation <m>\subseteq</m>, set containment.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We note that <m>I \in \cP</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let <m>\cT</m> be any totally ordered subset of <m>\cP</m>. 
                  If <m>\cT</m> is empty, then <m>\cT</m> is (vacuously) bounded above by <m>I</m>. 
                  Assume <m>\cT</m> is non-empty. 
                  Let <m>Z = \bigcup_{Y \in \cT} Y</m>. 
                  I claim <m>Z \in \cP</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Given <m>z_1, \dots, z_m \in Z</m>, for each <m>i</m> we have <m>z_i \in Y_i</m> for some <m>Y_i \in\cT</m>. 
                  Since <m>\cT</m> is totally ordered, one of <m>Y_1, \dots, Y_m</m> contains all the others and hence it contains all the <m>z_i</m>'s. 
                  Since each <m>Y_i</m> is linearly independent, this shows <m>z_1, \dots, z_m</m> are linearly independent. 
                  We have shown that every finite subset of <m>Z</m> is linearly independent, and hence <m>Z</m> is linearly independent. 
                  Since <m>\cT</m> is non-empty, <m>Z \supseteq I</m>. 
                  Since each member of <m>\cT</m> is contained in <m>S</m>, <m>Z \subseteq S</m>. 
                  Thus, <m>Z \in \cP</m>, and it is clearly an upper bound for <m>\cT</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We may thus apply <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/> to conclude that <m>\cP</m> has at least one maximal element, <m>B</m>. 
                  I claim <m>B</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Note that <m>B</m> is linearly independent and <m>I \subseteq B \subseteq S</m> by construction. 
                  We need to show that it spans <m>V</m>. 
                  Suppose not. 
                  Since <m>S</m> spans <m>V</m>, if <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then <m>\Span(B)</m> would have to be all of <m>V</m>. 
                  (For note that if <m>\Span(S) = V</m> and <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then for any <m>v \in V</m> we may write <m>v = \sum_i c_i s_i</m> for <m>s_i \in S</m> and <m>s_i = \sum_j a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m> with <m>b_{i,j} \in B</m> and hence <m>v= \sum_{i,j} c_i a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m>, which implies <m>\Span(B) = V</m>.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Since we are assuming <m>\Span(B) \ne V</m>, there must be at least one <m>v \in S</m> such that <m>v \notin \Span(B)</m>. 
                  Set <m>X := B \cup \{v\}</m>. 
                  Notice, <m>I \subset X \subseteq S</m> and, by CITEX , <m>X</m> is linearly independent. 
                  This shows that <m>X</m> is an element of <m>\cP</m> that is strictly bigger than <m>B</m>, contrary to the maximality of <m>B</m>. 
                  So, <m>B</m> must span <m>V</m> and hence it is a basis.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Thus <m>I</m> is contained in the basis <m>B</m>.

                        Using one <m>6</m>th primitive root we can obtain all the others, specifically <m>e^{2\pi i/6}</m>. 
                        So we multiply each root by this to get all the others. 
                        So we have our splitting field.

                      <p>
                        Since <m>\Q(a)</m> is Galois, we see that <m>[\Q(a):\Q]=6</m>. 
                        So <m>\Gal(\Q(a)/\Q)</m> is either <m>S_3</m> or <m>\Z/6.</m>

                        Additionally, note that <m>\frac{\alpha_i^3+1}{2}=\zeta</m> when <m>i=1,3,5</m> and <m>\frac{\alpha_i^3+1}{2}=\zeta^5</m> when <m>i=2,4,6</m>.

                        Similarly, we see that <m>\sigma(\alpha_3)=\alpha_6</m> and <m>\sigma(\alpha_4)=\alpha_5</m>. 
                        Thus <m>\sigma</m> corresponds to the permutation <m>(12)(36)(45)</m>.

                        Porism 
                        again we see there exists a <m>\tau\in\Gal(\Q(a)/\Q)</m> such that <m>\tau(\alpha_2)=\alpha_3</m>. 
                        Using a similar process as above we see that <m>\tau</m> corresponds to <m>(14)(23)(46)</m>. 
                        However, observe that <m>\sigma\tau=(153)(264)</m>, while <m>\tau\sigma=(135)(246)</m>. 
                        Thus these elements do not commute, so we cannot be in <m>\Z/6</m>. 
                        Thus <m>\Gal(\Q(a)/\Q)\cong S_3</m>.
