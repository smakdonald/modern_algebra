  "body": "Group Basics     Most great learning happens in groups.   Ken Robinson    Binary Operations and the Definition of a Group     A Brief Notational Aside  At various points throughout this text, the author may use \"mathcal\" notation for definitions that do not normally require it (such as for a group, for a ring, etc.). In the realm of higher mathematics, this is what is known as a typo , and should be reported to the proper authorities as soon as possible.   We begin, as all great volumes of mathematics are like to do, somewhere in the middle. Though everything that you need from the beginning can be found in . (Click on the footnote to reveal the text!)  Binary Operation   A binary operation on a set is a   binary operation      One of the nice things about binary operations is that they have properties.   Properties of Binary Operations   Let be a binary operation on a set .   An operation satisfies the associative property if, for all , we have . associative property     An operation satisfies the identity property if there exists such that for all . Such an element is called an identity element .  identity property     An operation satisfies the inverse property if, for each , there exists an element such that , where is an identity element of . The element is called an inverse of the element . inverse property        Group   A group is a pair , where is a set and is a binary operation on satisfying the associative , identity , and inverse properties. group       Though a group is a pair, we will usually refer to the group by only naming the underlying set, .    We say that is closed under the operation when we want to emphasize that for any the result of the operation, , is an element of . However note that closure is really part of the definition of a binary operation on a set, and it is implicitly assumed whenever we consider such an operation. This is the one and only \"Mark\". All following \"Marks\" will be \"Remarks\".     First Properties of Groups  Properties of Groups   Let be a group.  Unique Identity  The element satisfying the identity property is unique, and we thus refer to it as the identity element of . identity element (of a group)    Unique Inverses  For each , the element satisfying inverse property is unique, and we thus refer to it as the inverse of . inverse element    Cancellation  Suppose . If , then .  Similarly, if , then  cancellation (in groups)           Suppose there exist two elements, and , such that, for all , we have and . As is an identity element, by definition we have . Similarly, as is an identity element, we have . Combining these two equations, we see Thus , making the identity element unique.    Suppose an element has two inverses: and . Thus and . Observe Thus , making inverses unique.    Suppose for some . By the inverse property , has an inverse, such that . Observe         The inverse of an element is often written , for reasons we will see in the next section.    Abelian Groups  Additionally, a binary operation can be commutative .  Commutative Property   An operation satisfies the commutative property if for all . commutative property     It is perhaps natural at this stage to wonder about groups whose binary operation satisfies the commutative property. Some sort of commutative group , if you will. Surely such groups will be named accordingly. Right?  Abelian Group   An abelian group is a group that also satisfies commutative property. abelian group     Additive vs. Multiplicative Notation  When working with arbitrary groups, multiplicative notation is often used as the operation. Thus, groups are commonly written as and referred to as multiplicative groups . However, when working with abelian groups, it is customary to use additive notation, writing the group as . Often, the letter is used in place of when referring to abelian groups.    First Examples of Groups  All right. We've spent enough time wading around in the vagaries of abstraction. It's time to get our hands on some of these groups and see what all the fuss is about.  Group Examples      The trivial group is the group with a single element . trivial group       and each form an abelian group, where denotes traditional addition. The axioms of arithmetic guarantee the validity of the group axioms as well as the commutativity of the group operation. Thus all four groups are abelian. Yes, there is a lot of heavy lifting going on in the background that we're glossing over. In my defense, I did say we were starting somewhere in the middle...     For any positive integer , let Then is a non-abelian group under matrix multiplication known as the general linear group . general linear group      For any , let denote the . Then forms an abelian group where denotes addition modulo .    The quaternion group quaternion group  is a set with elements satisfying the following relations: is the identity element,         Specific General Linear Groups  In general, is a group for any field (whatever those are). To jump ahead and discover what those are, see: .    Identity Theft  In familiar groups of numbers, is used for the identity element of a multiplicative group (and likewise in additive groups). Often, is used for the identity element in arbitrary groups, though we will not do so here.   Not Quite Groups     The natural numbers do not form a group with respect to addition (as its underlying operation).    The rational numbers do not form a group with respect to multiplication.       Groups of Units  The following example illustrates a few important examples of something called a , which is defined explicitely in terms of rings (whatever those are) in the aptly named .  Groups of Units  group of units    Each of the following subsets form an abelian group under multiplication.   The subset of .     , , and .    For each , the subset of .        In latex , is written using \\times .    Some texts use the notation to denote groups of units. For example, would be written .     will be integral to our constructions of semidirect products in and our classifications of certain groups up to isomorphism (whatever that means). Though not strictly required for this text, knowing the structure of for various can prove helpful in some niche situations (read: certain qualifying exam problems).    Prove that .    Other Initial Examples and Properties  Some Extra Groups     Let be a multiplicative group, and define the opposite group , , to be the set equipped with the operation , where . Then is a group. Opposite groups are used in category theory to describe something called duality between algebraic structures.  opposite group      Let denote the set of even integers and denote the set of odd integers. Then is a group, whereas is not.           Let be a group.  Associativity of  Let be any elements . Observe Thus, associativity is satisfied in .   Identity Element of  As is a group, it contains an identity element, . I claim that is also the identity element of . Let . Thus for all Therefore, is the identity element of .   Inverses in  Let be an element in . Since is also an element of the group , by the inverse property there exists an inverse element in such that , where is the identity element of . Consider  and  From the previous part we see that is the identity element of , making the inverse of in . Thus every element in has an inverse in , satisfying the inverse element property.       Integer addition is associative, which means that for any three integers , and , the expression is equal to . Thus, associativity is satisfied for .  The identity element for addition is . For any even integer , adding to it does not change its parity (evenness). Hence, the identity element property is satisfied for .  For every even integer , there exists an inverse element denoted as such that . The negative of an even integer is also an even integer. Adding an even integer to its negative results in , which is the identity element. Therefore, the inverse element property is satisfied for .  The identity element for addition is . However, is not an odd integer, so the identity element property is not satisfied for .      Properties of Inverses   If is a group and , then    and               The element is defined to be the inverse of the element . I claim that is also the inverse of .  As is the inverse of , by the inverse property we have and , making the inverse of . Thus both and are inverses of the element . As inverses are unique , we see .    The element is defined to be the inverse of the element . I claim that is also the inverse of . Observe and Thus both and are inverses of , making them equal as inverses are unique .       The second portion of can be generalized.  Big 'Ole Inverses  If is a group and , then .   Generalized Associative Law generalized associative law  If an element of a group is contructed from a sequence of elements in this order by repeatedly inserting parenthesis and applying the operation, the element must equal and so is independent of the mode of bracketing.   As a result of any expression formed from the elements in that order can be written without parenthesis, which will save us oodles of time down the line. This is usually a result that is simply taken for granted and left unstated; we include it here for the sake of completenes - and ~rigor~. Yes, oodles is the best word to go here and no, I will not be changing it.       A is a set equipped with a that satisfies the associative , identity , and inverse properties. An abelian group is a group that also satisfies the .    The identity and inverse elements described in are unique . For inverses, we have and .

A -cycle is often called a transposition . cycle  transposition     latex Cycle Notation  In latex , \\, is used to add spacing between the symbols in a cycle. The command \\; can also be used for wider spacing.   Cycle  When regarded as an element of , sends to , to and to , and it fixes . (Note that the value of in cycle notation is sometimes ambiguous.)    Note that distinct lists of integers represent the same cycle if they are cyclical rearrangements of each other, e.g., . However, .   We compose cycles the same way we compose functions.  Composing Cycles  Consider This equation might lead you to the false belief that every element of is a cycle. This is not true — for example, the product cannot be written as a single cycle. What is true is that every element of is uniquely (up to ordering) the product of disjoint cycles. We'll prove that soon in .   Disjoint Commutes   Disjoint cycles commute, disjoint cycles that is, if , and then .    Let's consider two disjoint cycles, denoted as and , where 's and 's are distinct elements. Let's analyze the composition : When we apply the composition to an element , we have: Similarly, when we apply the composition to an element , we have: From these calculations, we can observe that the composition maps each element to (if ), and it maps to . Similarly, the composition maps each element to (if ), and it maps to .  Now, let's consider the composition and evaluate its effect on the elements and : and Comparing these results with the previous composition, we see that the effects on and are the same in both compositions. This implies that the compositions and are identical.  Therefore, we have shown that disjoint cycles commute, meaning that the order in which they are composed does not affect the final result.    While sufficent, this is not a necessary condition.  Non-Disjoint Commutes  Find elements that commute but are not disjoint.   Cycle Decompostion      Each can be written as a product (composition) of disjoint cycles cycle decompostion , and such a factorization is unique up to the ordering of the factors.    Each can be written a product of transpositions.         For the uniqueness part of statement (1) in one needs to establish a convention regarding -cycles, that is one needs to stipulate either that the -cycles will not be recorded (which gives the shortest such factorization) or that all the -cycles will be recorded (which gives the longest such factorization, but also the only one that makes it clear what the number is).   Now that we know that every permutation can be written as a product of transpositions, we can utilize this to gain insight into many aspects of the group structure, such as the order of elements.  Permutation Order   The order of a permutation is the least common multiple of the lengths of the cycles it is a product of. In particular, every transposition is its own inverse and the order of a -cycle in is .    Coming soon!     Even and Odd Permutations  We can also categorize elements of permutation groups by the number of transpositions it is a product of.

The sign homomorphism  that sends even permuations to and odd permutations to is a homomorphism. sign homomorphism           Let , and let denote the identity map on . Then Thus is operation preserving, making it a group homomorphism for any group .    Let , and let denote the zero map. As , is indeed a group homomorphism.    We begin by noting that is indeed a group, as , as seen in . Let . We proceed via cases.  First, suppose both and are even permutations. Thus is an even permutation by , and hence   Now suppose is even and is odd. Thus is an odd permutation by , and hence   Next, suppose is odd and is even. Thus is an odd permutation by , and hence   Finally, suppose both and are odd permutations. Thus is an even permutation by , and hence   This shows is a homomorphism in all cases.           The exponential map exponential map  is a homomorphism.    The natural log map natural log map  is a homomorphism.    For any positive integer , the map determinant map determinant map  is a group homomorphism.      Specifically, homomorphisms will preserve the additive structure, such as the identity element and inverse elements.  Homomorphism Preservations   If is a homomorphism of groups, then the following hold:         .       Let be a homomorphism of groups.   Observe:     Let . I claim that is the inverse of in : Thus and are both inverses of in , and so , since inverses are unique .        Let be a homomorphism of groups, and let . Then .   Compositions of Homomorphisms   If and are group homomorphisms, the composition is a group homomorphism.    Suppose and be group homomorphisms, and let . Thus is a group homomorphism.    Sweet  Let and be abelian groups. Then the set of all group homomorphisms from to is itself an abelian group.    Kernel   Let be a homomorphism of groups. The kernel of is the set  (groups)  kernel (of a group homomorphism)     Injective and Surjective Homomorphisms      A group homomorphism is injective if and only if . Such homomorphisms are called monomorphisms     A group homomorphism is surjective if and only if . Such homomorphisms are called epimorphisms            Suppose is injective. By we know . Thus and .  Let . Thus . As is injective, this means . Hence , making the two sets equal.   Suppose . Suppose further there exist such that .  I claim is the inverse of . Observe Thus , meaning . Therefore, is the inverse of , making as  inverses are unique . Hence, is injective.    This proof is identical to that of ; the homomorphism aspect adds nothing of interest. Though one could argue that adding nothing of interest is interesting, causing it to add something of interest.        Homomorphisms and Order  If is a homomorphism of groups and is finte, then .    Isomorphism? I Know 'em!    The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.   F. Scott Fitzgerald   Group Ismorphism   A homomorphism is called an isomorphism if there exists a homomorphism such that and .  If is an isomorphism, and are called isomorphic , written . Isomorphic  isomorphism (of groups)  isomorphic (as groups)     latex :  In latex , is written using \\cong .   Intuitively, a group isomorphism establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of two groups, such that they have exactly the same algebraic structure. This means that the groups are essentially the same, up to a relabeling of their elements.  Equivalent Isomorphism Characterization   Suppose is a group homomorphism. Then an isomorphism if and only if is bijective (one-to-one and onto).     Suppose an isomorphism. Then there exists a homomorphism such that and . Thus is invertible . By  is bijective.  ( ) Suppose is bijective homomorphism. By  is invertible, meaning there exists some function   Notice we use , not ! We are not able to assume is a homomorphism, we must prove this! such that and .  I claim is actually a homomorphism: For we have Thus Since is bijective it is injective, and thus , making a homomorphism.     Moving forward, we will essentially treat as the de-facto definition of a group isomorphism. Rather than end every proof with a reference to , we will instead enshrine its monumental achievements of within this remark. To alleviate some of the corresponding guilt asociated with this decision I am referencing as many times as possible, as is important and should not be forgotten.   Isomorphism Examples     The identity map is a group isomomorphism for any group .     .     , where is as defined in .      More Isomorphisms     Let be a group and the of . Then .         The exponential and natural logarithm maps from are inverses, making them isomorphisms as well.      Isomorphism Invariants   Let and be groups. If is an isomorphism, then the following hold: isomorphism invariant       .     for all and for all .     is abelian if and only if is abelian.       Let be an isomorphism of groups with inverse .   By  is a bijective function between and . Thus .    Let and , and let denote the orders of , respectively. Thus and Thus and .  I claim and are the smallest positive integers where this holds. Suppose by way of contradiction there exist and such that and . But then and As and , this contradicts and .     Suppose is abelian, and let . Thus every element two elements in commute, making abelian.   Suppose is abelian, and let . Thus every element two elements in commute, making abelian.       Something's Missing  Justify why the following pairs of groups are not isomorphic.   and    and    and    and      There Can Only Be One...  All trivial groups are (canonically) isomorphic. Hence, we usually speak of the trivial group.   Isomorphisms form Equivalence Relation           If , then     If and , then           The identity map from is an isomorphism , making isomorphic to .    Suppose is an isomorphism. Then there exists a homomorphism such that and . Thus is an isomorphism from to , and so .    Let and be isomorphisms. From we see is a homomorphism of groups. As both and are injective, is injective by . Similarly, as both and are surjective, is surjective by . Thus is a bijective homomorphism from to , we see by         The quotation marks in the title of this result are important. Equivalence relations as we know them are only defined on sets , but there is no set of all groups, much as there is no set of all sets. This dips into the realm of Russel's Paradox and higher category theory, which we will steer clear of for the time being.    Automorphism? I'm Am 'em!    Self preservation is the first law of nature.   Samuel Butler  Group Automorphism   Let be a group. An isomorphism is called an automorphism  automorphism (of a group) of .     In we saw that the identity map is a group isomomorphism from a group to itself, making an automorphism.   Automorphism Group   The set of automorphisms of a group is called the automorphism group of and denoted . automorphism group (of a group)      Let's verify that this group is indeed what it claims to be. The more pedantic reader might object to a group claiming anything, as it is an abstract concept. However, the more sassy author would politely tell them to keep it to themselves.   The Automorphism Group   The set of automorphisms of , denoted , is a group under composition.    First, I show that operation is associative. Let . As function composition is associative , we see .  I claim is the identity element of . Recall from that is indeed an automorphism. Let . We will show . As all functions share the same domain and co-domain, we need only show that the functions map elements equally, Let , and observe: Thus is indeed the identity element in .  Finally, I show that every automorphism has an inverse, Let . As is an isomorphism, there exists a homomorphism such that and . Thus is, itself, an automorphism of , and so , making the inverse of .    Complex Conjugation Automorphism  The function given by is an automorphism.         Notice that we have already shown that the composition of automorphisms is an automorphism, both through (as automorphisms are isomorphisms) and (as groups are closed under their operation)   Inner Automorphism   Let be a group and . The function defined by is called the inner automorphism inner automorphism of induced by . The set of inner automorphisms inner automorphism group of is denoted .     Let's make sure this is indeed an automorphism to avoid any potential awkwardness down the line.  Conjugation Automorphism   Let be a group and . Then for all .    Let be a group and . For any , observe proving that is a homomorhism from to itself.  I claim holds for any . Observe Additionally, notice that for all , and thus .  As , it follows and . This proves has a two-sided inverse and hence is an isomorphism. In fact, it shows that . Thus for all .     In this text is primarily reserved for conjugation automorphisms, where the subscript identifies which element is doing the conjugating.    There is a notion of outer automorphisms as well, though we currently lack the tools to define them rigorously.        A is a function between groups that preserves certain algebraic structures, such as the operation, identites, and inverses. For the first, see: . For the second and third, see: The set of elements mapped to the identity by a homomorphism is known as its .    A is a bijective homomorphism, and a is an isomorphism from a group to itself. The structures preserved by an isomorphism are known as .    The set of automorphisms of a group forms a group itself: the of the group. See: Specifically, the will prove very important later.    Compositions of homomorphisms, isomorphisms, and automophisms are again homomorphisms, isomorphisms, and automophisms, respectively.     "

Friedrich Nietzsche   We zoom in now on the wondrous case in which a group can be generated by a single element.  Cylic Group   If is a generated by a single element, i.e. for some , then is called a cyclic group . cyclic group     Recalling , we can describe the elements of a cylic group explicitely.  Elements of   For an element of , the elements of can be described as: .    By , the group has the following elements .  First, we show . I claim each of the elements are distinct. Indeed, if and then and , contradicting the minimality of the order of .  Next, we show . I claim (this implies ). Indeed, for any  division by yields integers with such that . Then .    One quick way of seeing if a finite group is cyclic is to find an element with the same order as the group.  Cyclic iff Element of Order   Let be a finite group. Then is cyclic if and only if there exists an such that     Cyclic Groups       is a cyclic group.     is a cyclic group.           , for example.     , such that        Not Quite Cyclic Groups     Prove that is not a cyclic group.    Prove that is not cyclic.      Generators of cyclic groups are not necessarily unique.  Cyclic Generators are not Unique  Let be a cyclic group. Then .   Here is a more general criteria for determining when an element of a cyclic group is a generator.  Criteria for Cyclic Generators   Let be a cyclic group of order , and let . Then generates if and only if .    Conveniently enough, cyclic groups are always abelian.  Cyclic Groups are Abelian   Every cyclic group is abelian.    Suppose is a cylic group, and let . As is cyclic, for some . By , . Thus and for some . Observe: Hence is abelian.    Roots of Unity  For a fixed , is a subgroup of . Since and so if , then and hence for some real number . Moreover, implies that is an integer multiple of . It follows that and that generates . So, is cyclic or order . It is therefore isomorphic to , via the map .   One of the first things one does when encountering a new group is to examine its subgroups. As it turns out, cyclic groups have some very special properties when it comes to subgroups, though proving them will be more technical than anything we have encountered thus far.  Finally, we end with two results that will prove invaluable later in the course. Though we won't see them for some time, proving them now will be good practice and save us time later on.    The automorphism group of is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of units of via the map where .    In particular:    If is prime the automorphism group of is cyclic, namely .     Subgroups of Cyclic Groups  Generating Subgroups of Cyclic Groups   Let , where has finite order . For any , setting gives that .    Since any element of is of the form for some .

The opposite containment follows because and is the smallest subgroup of containing . Thus .    Subgroups of Cyclic Groups   Let , where has finite order . Then there is a bijection for each divisor of . Moreover, for each subgroup of , . In particular, all subgroups of are cyclic and there is a unique subgroup of each order.    Let and be given by . I claim that for any divisor of , we have .  We have .  For any subgroup of , we have .  By any is either , for which or is of the form . In the latter case, setting we have and . It remains to show that . By Bézout's Identity, for some integers . Since if follows that . On the other hand is a multiple of so and thus . Finally, we conclude that for any .  Thus is a two sided inverse to , making a bijection.    latex :  In latex , is written using \\Psi .   Cyclic Groups of Small Order     Every group of orders are cyclic.    Every abelian group of order is cyclic.       Uniqueness of Cyclic Groups    There is no way to be in cyclic existence without creating the causes of suffering.   Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo   Universal Mapping Property for Cyclic Groups   Assume and let be any group. If , then for each such that , there is a unique group homomorphism such that .

So is an endomorphism (e.g. a homomorphism from a group to itself) of mapping to . But the identity map also has this property, and so the uniqueness clause gives . Similarly, .     Moving forward, it is customary to denote the cyclic group of order with the notation . We similarly denote the infinite cyclic group .         A is a group generated by one element. Thus .

Maya Angelou   Sometimes it is convenient to ignore a certain subobject of a given object and to focus on the remaining properties. Formally, this is done by taking quotients . In contrast to the theory of vector spaces, where the quotient of any vector space by any subspace again naturally forms a vector space, we have to be a little bit more careful in the world of groups. Only special subgroups lead to quotient groups :  Normal Subgroup   A subgroup of a group is normal in , written , if for all . normal subgroup       In latex , is written using \\unlhd , though this text uses the command \\def\\nsg{\\unlhd} , where nsg stands for normal subgroup    Anything but Normal   Come up with a better name for normal subgroups than 'normal subgroup'.

Imagine if we called all those things normal too! It would be a nightmare. And we would deserve it for our hubris.     Ideal subgroup : Look, its shorter! Normal subgroups and ideals parallel ideas in group and ring theory, and relabeling normal groups in this way would cement these similarities.       However, there are many ways to characterize normal subgroups.  Equivalent Normal Characterizations   Let be a subgroup of a group . The following are equivalent:         for all .     for all .    The equivalence relations on determined by the left and right cosets of coincide.       Arguably, the most important and \/ or intuitive characterization of normal subgroups comes from their relation to homomorphisms. Indeed, though we currenly lack the tools to prove it, tells us that a subgroup is normal if and only if it is the kernel of some homomorphism. Thus, in addition to its necessity in the definition of quotients, a normal subgroup is a simple and unique way to characterize any homomorphism.

Arthur Wellesley   The information encoded in a group action has two basic parts: one part tells us where points go and the other part tells us how points stay put. The following terminology refers to these ideas.  Orbit   Let be a group acting on a set . For an element the orbit of is  orbit      A fun fact about orbits is that they've secretly been at the heart of everything we've been doing so far.  Familiar Orbits   Let be a group.   Let act upon itself by . Under this action, .    Let act upon itself by . Under this action, .       All the way back in we proved that the set of cosets induced an equivalence relation on the group. As we saw in , left cosets turn out to be a special kind of orbit. Luckily for us, the equivalence relation generalizes.    Let be a group acting on a set . The equivalence relation on induced by the action of , written , is defined by if and only if there is a such that . The equivalence classes of are the orbits. equivalence relation induced by a group action     Orbits Partition the Group   Let be a group acting on a set . Then    is an equivalence relation;    for any , either or ; and     .       We'll have a lot more to say about orbits, but first they'll need a friend.  Stabilizer   Let be a group acting on a set . For an element the stabilizer is  stabilizer       Sometimes (including on old qualifying exams) the notation is used to denote the stabilizer. Given that this notation gives no context as to what the set is or what it does, we will stick to .   Stabilizers are Subgroups  The stabilizer is a subgroup of .   One of the most important facts about the action of a group on a finite set is the following:  The Length of the Orbit is the Index of the Stabilizer (LOIS)  LOIS   Let be a group that acts on a finite set via . For any we have     Let be the collection of left cosets of in . Define a function by . This function is well defined and one-to-one: The function is onto by definition of . Thus is a bijection and it yields equalities     Length isn't a word we have used to describe size or cardinality before, but I suppose that SOIS and COIS just don't quite roll of the tongue quite the same.  Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem  orbit-stabilizer theorem   Let be a finite group that acts on a finite set via . For any we have      Take note that only applies when is a finite group.   Transitive iff One Orbit   An action is transitive if and only if there is exactly one orbit under the action. Similarly, an action is transitive if and only if every stabilizer is trivial.    Lets look at some group actions of a more geometric flavor. What do you think geometry tastes like? Which field of mathematics would taste the best?   Symmetries of the Cube  Let be the group of rotational symmetries of the cube and let act on the collection of faces of the cube in the evident way. This action is transitive and so the one and only orbit has length . It follows that for any face of the cube, has index and, since we already know that , it follows from that . That is, there are four symmetries that map to itself. Indeed, they are the rotations by , , or degrees about the line of symmetry passing through the mid-point of and the mid-point of the opposite face.   That was fun and all, but I just feel like there weren't enough faces...  Symmetries of the Dodecahedron  Let be the group of rotatoinal symmetries of the dodecahedron ( pentagonal faces). The evident action of on the twleve faces is transitive. For each face , clearly has elements: the five rotations about the line joining the midpoint of to the midpoint of the face on the opposite side. Since and , we conclude .   As a final note, we are now able to connect the concepts of transitive and faithful actions in a more meaningful way.  Transitive and Faithful   Suppose that is an abelian group acting transitively and faithfully on a set . Then .    Let . As the action is transitive, by the exercise above we have that the kernel of the action is the intersection of over all . However, as is abelian, for all . Hence, the kernel of the action is for any . On the other hand, the action is faithful, which means the kernel of the action is the identity. It follows that for every . Finally, as the action is transitive, for some (any) . By , .     The Class Equation    Let the others have the charisma. I've got the class.   George H. W. Bush   Centralizer   Let be a group. For any , is called the centralizer of in  centralizer       Many texts use the notation for the centralzier and for conjugacy classes. However, given that the center of a group is denoted with , we argue that makes more intuitive sense for the centralizer, freeing up for conjugacy classes.   Center is Intersection of Centrilizers  Prove that    Normalizer   Let be a group. For any , is called the normalizer of in . normalizer       Notice that when consists of just one element, , we have .

Here's a quick refresher:  Let be a group acting on a set , and let .    : The of in .     The of in .     The of in .     The of in .     The of in .

Size of Conjugacy Class Divides   For a finite group , the size of any conjugacy class divides .    Class Equation  class equation   Let be a finite group and let be a list of unique representatives of all of the conjugacy classes of of size greater than . Then     The elements of are precisely the group elements that are conjugate to only themselves; that is, they are the one-element orbits for the conjugation action. Because the conjugacy classes (orbits of the conjugation action) partition we have For each as in the statement, by , we have . The follows from substituting this into the equation above.    The provides a way of decomposing a group into its conjugacy classes, which are fundamental building blocks of the group and are essential in more advanced topics, such as representation and character theory.  It also gives us information about the size and structure of the center of a group. (Read: when a proof involves the center of a group from here on out, the is probably a good place to start)      In a group action, the of an element is the set of points that the element is mapped to under the action, and the is set of all points that fix .

One aspect of Sylow theory is that it allows us to deduce, in certain special cases, the existence of a unique subgroup of a given order, and thus it allows one to construct a normal subgroup.   Groups of Prime Order  -group   For a prime number , a -group is a group of order for some . -group     Center of -group is Nontrivial   If is a prime number and is a finite group of order for some , then is not the trivial group (In fact for some ).

For example, it can be used to prove the existence of subgroups of a given order in a group, and it is a key ingredient in the proof of , which provides information about the structure of finite groups.   has since been generalized and extended in many ways, and it is now a fundamental result in the theory of finite groups, where it plays a central role in the classification of groups of small order.   Sylow Subgroups  Sylow -subgroup   Let be a finite group and a prime. Write the order of as where . A Sylow -subgroup of is a subgroup such that . That is, a Sylow -subgroup of is a subgroup whose order is the highest conceivable power of according to .

Sylow Subgroups in  In , the Sylow -subgroups are the cyclic groups for any five cycle , so because there are five cycles, but there are four of these in every Sylow -subgroup. The Sylow -subgroups are the cyclic groups for any three cycle , so because there are three cycles, but there are two of these in every Sylow -subgroup.

If is a Sylow -subgroup of and is any -subgroup of (i.e., a subgroup whose order is some power of ), then there is a such that .

We proceed by considering two cases, depending on whether or not divides .  If , then by , there is an element of order . Set . Since , we have . Since , by induction has a subgroup of order (i.e. of index ). By , this subgroup corresponds to a subgroup of of index , hence of order .  For the second case, assume and consider the for : where are a complete and non-redundant list of non-central conjugacy class representatives. Since and , we must have for at least one . For this , we have where . Since is not central, and hence, by induction, contains a subgroup of order . But this subgroup is also a subgroup of .    Let be a Sylow -subgroup and let be any -subgroup. Let denote the collection of all conjugates of : Part (3) tells us the consists of all Sylow -subgroups of , but we don't yet know this. Nonetheless, acts (transitively) on by conjugation, and thus also acts on (not necessarily transitively). The key to proving parts (2) and (3) of the Sylow Theorem is to analyse the action of on to establish and below.  Let be the orbits of the action of on , and for each pick a representative . We have , where the last equation uses the Lemma. By LOIS, we thus have and hence   This equation holds for any -subgroup of . In particular, we can take . In this case the first term is and, since for all , the remaining terms are divisible by . This gives (This does not yet prove part (3) since we don't yet know that consists of all Sylow -subgroups.)  We can now prove part (2): By way of contradiction, suppose is a -subgroup of such that is not contained in any of the subgroups belonging to . Then for all and thus every term on the right-hand side of is divisble by , contrary to . The second assertion in (2) follows by taking to be a Sylow -subgroup.  This proves, in particular, that in fact does consist of all Sylow -subgroups.    Part (3) thus follows from .    For any , the stabilizer of for the action of on by conjugation is . Since we now know the action is transitive, Moreover, since and , it follows that .        provides a systematic way of analyzing the subgroups of a finite group. It allows us to determine the number of subgroups of a given order, which is useful in many applications, such as studying the structure of solvable and simple groups. The theorems also provide information about the normalizers of subgroups, which can be used to study normal subgroups and quotient groups.   In general, can be deduced from part one of . For say . Then there exists a Sylow -subgroup of . Pick any , . Then for some . Then has order .

As any -cycle or -cycle must be contained in a Sylow -subgroup (since such elements generate subgroups of order , for some ) and there are six -cycles and six -cycles, there has to be more than one Sylow -subgroup. Hence, there are precisely distinct subgroups of order .  As all of them are conjugate, and conjugation induces an isomorphism on the group, we see that all three subgroups are isomorphic. Hence, we just need to show that contains a subgroup isomorphic to . Let be the set of left cosets of the subgroup of . Note that . Let act on by left multiplication. This action induces a homomorphism where is the permutation group on . As shown in class, the kernel of this homomorphism is the largest normal subgroup contained in , which is .

No Simple Groups of Order (Counting Elements)  counting elements  element counting argument   Let us prove that no group or order is simple.    Let be any group of order . We will prove that must have either a normal subgroup of order or a normal subgroups of oder .   gives that is either or and is either or . If either of these numbers is , we have a unique subgroup of order or of order , and such a subgroup must be normal. Suppose these numbers are and , respectively. We deduce a contradition by counting elements .  In detail, say are the Sylow -subgroups. By  for all . Thus the set  has elements, one of which is and the other of which must have order . That is, there are elements of order in . But now consider the three Sylow -subgroups . Each has order and for all . It follows that for all , and thus , a contradiction.     In the previous example, it would not be so easy to count elements of order and . We do know that every element in has order , or (any only one has order ), but the size of this set is harder to calculate. For notice that might have order . The most one can say for sure is that has at least elements.   No Simple Groups of Order (Group Actions)  group action argument   No group of order is simple.    By way of contradiciton suppose is simple and . gives and (since they cannot be by the assumption that is simple). The counting elements trick would work, but let's proceed in a different way: Consider the action of on by conjugation and let be the associated homomorphism (obtained by choosing a numbering of the members of ). The map is non-trivial since the action is transitive (part (2) of ). But does not divide and so cannot be injective. It follows that is a non-trivial, proper normal subgroup of , a contradiction.    No Simple Groups of Order (Normalizers)  normalizer argument   No group of order is simple.    By way of contradiction suppose is a simple group of order . Since , we conclude from that   If any of these is , then the corresonding Sylow -subgroup is unique and hence normal, a contradiction.  Although it is not actually needed here, let's show cannot be or . For example, if it were , then the action of on (by conjugation) gives a homomorphism . Since the action is transitive, this homomorphism cannot be the trivial map. Since does not divide , this map cannot be injective. Thus the kernel of is a non-trivial, proper normal subgroup, a contradiction. In a similar way one shows .  We have shown that the only possibility is One is now tempted to count elements: we have elements of order and elements of order . But elements of order are not so easy to count since the various Sylow -subgroups have nine elements each and might interect in subsets of order . The only obvious things is that there are at least of them. This does not give enough elements to reach a contradiction.  The action of on leads to a homomorphism , but since does divide , there is no contradiction lurking here either.  So, we must resort to something really sneaky: let be all of the Sylow -subgroups. Observe that if  for all , then we would have elements of order or . This would give at least elements, which is not possible. So, it must be the case that at least two intersect non-trivially. Without loss, let's say is such that . We ponder . Since is abelian and , , so that . Likewise, too, and since , we get . And of course . We get only three possibilities: Let us show that each is impossible:  If , then we have constructed a subgroup of of index . The action of on the left cosets gives a homomorphism that cannot be the trivial map since the action is transitive. But it cannot be injective either, and this leads to a non-trivial nomal subgroup. The exact same reasoning shows cannot be (or we could use that it has index ). Finally, if , then , which is also impossible.    is Simple    is simple.    the Unique Simple Group of Order   If is a simple group of order , then .    Assume is simple of order . Let us first observe that it suffices to construct a non-trivial action of on a set with elements. For given such an action we obtain a non-trivial homomorphism . Since it's non-trivial and is simple, we must have , so that is injective. Thus , and . But we already know that is the only subgroup of of order , and thus .  So, we only need to find such an action, and one's first guess would be the action on one of the sets of Sylow -subgroups. By Sylow Theory and the fact that is simple (so that no Sylow -subgroup for can be unique) we get   The next important observation is:   There is no non-trivial action of on a set of size at most .   For if there was such a non-trivial action, we would get a homomorphism for (if , the only action is the trivial one). Such a homomorphism cannot be injective by order considerations. So, it's kernel would be a proper, non-trivial normal subgroup, which do not exist.  In particular, and , so that   If then we are done, since this action is transitive and thus certainly non-trivial.  Suppose and let be all the Sylow -subgroups. Since and , has elements of order or . If for all , we would have elements of order or , which is far too many elements in total. At least two of these must therefore intersect non-trivially and without loss say has two elements. We consider . As in the preivious example, and hence , , and . The possibilities are If then , which is impossible. If , then we obtain an transitive action of on the three element set of left cosets of in , which as shown above is not possible. We are left with . Thus acts transitively (and hence non-trivially) on the five element set of left cosets of in .     The proof shows that if either or , but in hindsight only one of these can actually be possible. It's actually the former: has no elements of order (since four cycles are odd permuations) and the only elements of order are products of two disjoint transpotions, and there are such elements. It's not hard to see that the five -element subgroups of given by the Klein -group and its obvious conjugates (i.e., those obtained by leaving out one of instead of ) are the only Sylow -subgoups of .    A Wealth of Problems on Simple Groups   Let G be a group of order . Prove that is not simple.   By we know that and . Thus our options are and . Suppose that .  Let act on by conjugation, yielding the homomorphism via the . This map is non-trivial from part (2) of , but does not divide , and thus cannot be injective.

Prove that no group of order is simple.   Let be a group of order and suppose by way of contradiction that is simple. Notice that . By , we know and divides , the only options are thus and .

A is a group with only two normal subgroups: itself and the trivial subgroup.

We have shown that the only possibility is One is now tempted to count elements: we have elements of order and elements of order . But elements of order are not so easy to count since the various Sylow -subgroups have nine elements each and might interect in subsets of order . The only obvious things is that there are at least of them. This does not give enough elements to reach a contradiction.  The action of on leads to a homomorphism , but since does divide , there is no contradiction lurking here either.  So, we must resort to something really sneaky: let be all of the Sylow -subgroups.

We get only three possibilities: Let us show that each is impossible:  If , then we have constructed a subgroup of of index .

The exact same reasoning shows cannot be (or we could use that it has index ). Finally, if , then , which is also impossible.   "

We have with factors .    The composition factors of are and . This holds since , , and is simple, facts that we will prove later.   We close this subsection with some big-picture type comments. A normal subgroup of a group is analogous to a factor of an integer, and a composition series of a finite group is analogous to a prime factorizations of integers. In this analogy, the role of a prime number is played by a simple group. One major difference is that, unlike for prime factorizations, the list of composition factors of a group do not uniquely determine the group since, for example, and (and, for that matter, any solvable group of order ) have the same composition factors but are certainly not isomorphic.  Nonetheless, a major motivating idea in finite group theory is the following: In order to know everything about finite group theory, one merely needs to know:   a complete list of all simple groups and    a method of reconstructing all possible finite groups having a given list of composition factors.     The former task was essentially accomplished by the 1980's, when all finite simple groups were classified into a handful of families along with  sporadic simple groups. The latter task is probably not really possible as stated here. But, there is a large collection of properties of finite groups such that if holds for all members of a compostion series of a given group then also holds for the group itself. For such a property , it suffices to check that holds true for every finite simple group. This technique has been used with success.   Solvable Groups    The What, Where, and Why of Group Presentations   Why are solvable groups important? Where are they found? What are they used for?      Galois Theory  A key result of Galois theory is that a polynomial equation is solvable by radicals (i.e., its roots can be expressed using basic arithmetic operations and roots) if and only if its associated Galois group is solvable. This result connects group theory directly to classical problems in algebra.   Lie Groups and Algebraic Groups  In the study of Lie groups, solvable groups often serve as a starting point for understanding more complex groups. A classic example is the Borel subgroups in the theory of algebraic groups, which are connected solvable groups and play a central role in the classification of algebraic groups.   Representation Theory  The representations of solvable groups are particularly well-understood due to the fact that these groups have abelian quotients at each level of their derived series. This allows techniques from the representation theory of abelian groups to be extended to solvable groups.   Topology  In the classification of -manifolds, the fundamental group of certain types of 3-manifolds (such as Seifert-fibered spaces) is solvable. Understanding these groups is crucial for classifying the topology of the manifold.   Algebraic Geometry  The knot group of a knot in -dimensional space is the fundamental group of the knot complement (the space obtained by removing the knot from ).

A group ring is an algebraic structure that combines concepts from group theory and ring theory. It is constructed by \"attaching\" a ring to a group, allowing you to study the group's structure using ring-like operations.    Let be a group and let be a commutative ring with (often is taken to be a field). Let be the collection of formal expressions of the form indicated below, where the operation is assumed to be commutative: Equivalently, a typical element of can be written as , where for all and for all but a finite number of 's.  We can make into a ring by defining and   With these definitions, is a ring, called the group ring of with coefficients in . It is a unital ring with identity . If is a field then is an -vector space. group ring       Some authors write as , but the notation is more standard.     Let be any commutative ring and a group. Then is commutative if and only if is abelian.     Let denote the group of quaterinons and the field of real numbers, and let us consider the group ring . Actually, the notation here is not so good since is easily confused with , and, even worse, things like , are highly confusing. So, let us rename the elements of , so that so that is what we were writing as , is what we were writing as , is what we were writing as , etc. So, for example, we now have in this group.   is a non-commutative ring, and you might guess that it is the same as the quaterinons defined above, but it can't be: is -dimensional as a -vector space whereas is dimensional. In fact is not a division ring, since it has zero divisors: and so neither of the two factors can be units.  The problem is that is not the same thing as , but we want them to be the same in . Once we learn about quotient rings, we will be able to show that is the quotient of by the ideal generated by . Roughly this means we mod out by the relation and all consequences of this relation. For example, once one imposes this equivalence relation, the element becomes the zero element.     For any commutative ring , the inclusion given by lands in and induces a homomorphism of abelian groups .  Note that by definition of multiplication in .     Lemma 2.18 . If is a field, is an -vector space and is a basis, so that .    Example 2.5 . Take and . Then is a six dimensional real vector space with basis . An element is any expression of the form where are real numbers. This ring has some zero divisors — for example Here we are abusing notation a bit — for example, is really . In general, is just written as in and is just written as , since is the additive inverse of .   Exercise 2.19 .  We identify as a subset of in the obvious way (by identifying with ).  This gives that for any we have thus is a unit in with inverse . This shows that .  The formula also gives that the map is group homomorphism. ◻  Motivation: The What, Where, and Why of Groups   Why are group rings important? Where are they found? What are they used for?      (Co)homology  To compute group cohomology, we often work with projective resolutions of -modules, which are constructed from the group ring .   Representation Theory  The group ring acts on vector spaces, allowing one to study how groups can be represented by linear transformations. This is fundamental for studying symmetries and representations of finite and infinite groups. A representation of on a vector space can be viewed as a module over the group ring , which means that becomes a left -module, and the action of on a vector in corresponds to multiplication by as an element of .   Module Theory  Studying modules over group rings helps in understanding structures such as projective modules, simple modules, and injective modules.   Algebraic Number Theory  Group rings are used in the study of class field theory and Galois groups. They are also employed in the study of cyclotomic fields and class numbers, where group rings like arise naturally.   K-Theory  In algebraic -theory, the classification of projective modules over a ring is central. For a group ring , projective modules over correspond to certain representations of . The -theory groups (for ) provide information about the structure of these modules. In particular, classifies finitely generated projective modules up to isomorphism, which has connections to representations of .        What is a Polynomial Ring?   Group rings give lots of cool examples of rings, but we will now just focus on the boring case when is a free abelian group (written with multiplicative notation) generated by . In this case an element of may be written uniquely as for . For any commutative ring a typical element of is thus This is a Laurent polynomial in the variables with -coefficients. Say and let , so that . Then with is a representative example of an element of . Addition is by combining like powers of . Multiplication is uniquely determined by the fact that it must satisfy the distributive law and for .   It is clear that from the rules for and that if we consider those elements with for all in a Laurent polynomial ring, we obtain a subring:    Let be a free abelian groups with generators . For any commutative ring , the polynomial ring in , written , is the subring of consisting of (finite) sums of the form  polynomial ring      Example 2.8 . If , letting , then consists of all expressions of the form with for all but a finite number of .   Definition 2.22 . Let be a commutative ring with and let be a monoid (set endowed with a binary operation that is associative and has an identity). The monoid ring  is the set of formal expressions with operations defined by:     Definition 2.23 . The polynomial ring on variables with coefficients in is the monoid ring on the free abelian monoid where each is identified with with the 1 in the -th position.   Remark 2.24 . When , one is tempted to think of as being a subring of the ring of continuous, real-valued functions that are defined on all of . This is not technically true: elements of are just formal expressions, not functions. But there is an injective ring homomorphism (see below) given by identifying a polynomial expression in one variable having coefficients with a function in the usual way.   "

Here is an equivalent characterization of prime ideals that will become very useful in a later course on commutative algebra.

  "body": "Modules and Algebras  Modules    Complexity that works is built up out of modules that work perfectly, layered one over the other.   Kevin Kelly   Modules are a generalization of the concept of a vector space to any ring of scalars. But while vector spaces make for a great first example of modules, many of the basic facts we are used to from linear algebra are often a little more subtle over a general ring. These differences are features, not bugs. We will introduce modules, study some general linear algebra, and discuss the differences that make the general theory of modules richer and even more fun.  Module   Let be a ring (with ).   A left  - module is an abelian group together with a pairing , written , such that for all and     ,     ,     , and     .     A right  - module is an abelian group together with a pairing , written , such that for all and     ,     ,     , and     .    -module    Often, the elements of the ring are referred to as scalars , and the four rules given above are referred to as an - action . module  left -module  right -module  scalars (of am -module)  action (of an -module)     Typically, one first encounters modules in an undergraduate linear algebra course: the vector spaces from linear algebra are modules over fields. Later, we will see that vector spaces are much simpler modules than modules over other rings. So while one might take linear algebra and vector spaces as an inspiration for what to expect from a module, be warned that this perspective can often be deceiving.  Vector Space   Let be a field. An - vector space is a (left) -module. vector space     Modules in Commutative Rings  If is a commutative ring, then any left -module may be regarded as a right -module by setting . Likewise, any right -module may be regarded as a left -module.    For non-commutative rings, left and right modules are not the same: trying to make a left -module into a right one by setting fails to satisfy the second axiom, since and , and, unless , we cannot conclude that .   Module and Opposite Ring  For a ring , recall the opposite ring, , as defined in . Given a left -module , prove that is a right -module via the same rule for addition but with the rule for scaling on the right defined to be for any and .   Arithmetic in Modules   Let be a ring and let be a (left) -module. Then for all and we have    ,     ,     , and     .         First, note , which is an ableian group. Observe As from above, we have by .  Observe As from above, we have by .  Obersve Since is also the additive inverse of , we have by Part (2) of .  Finally,       Examples of Modules    For any ring , the zero module is with for any . zero module   Every ring is a left module over itself with the rule for scaling given by the ring multiplication rule. It is also a right module over itself.  More generally, if is any ring and is a left ideal, then is a left- -module.  Let be a field and (the ring of matrices with entries in ). Let be the collection of column vectors with entries in having entries. The usual rules for adding column vectors and multiplying column vectors on the left by matrices make into a left -module. Likewise if is the collection of all row vector with entries in , the is a right -module via addition and matrix multiplication.   For a non-negative integer , the “standard\" free (left) -module of rank is the set equipped with the operations  standard free module        Prove that an -module is the zero module if and only if the zero and identity maps on are equal.   Closure Properties of Modules  Given -modules and and an ideal , the following are -modules:               From 817 we already know they are subgroups under , and it is evident from the definitions that each is closed under scaling by elements of .   Abelian Groups are -modules   Let be an abelian group under . Then becomes a -module upon defining the rule for scaling to be    for any and .    Coming soon!    Modules  Let be a positive integer and recall that denotes the ring of integers modulo (whose elements I will write as ).   Show that if is any abelian group (under the operation ) such that for all (where ), then the pairing given makes into a -module. (Be sure to check this pairing is well-defined.)    Conversely, show that if is a -module, then the underlying abelian group has the property that for all .      Submodule   Let be a ring and let be a left -module. An -submodule of is a subset such that    is a subgroup of under (so, we have , if then , and if then ), and     for all and .    submodule     We could equivalently define submodule to be a subset of that is an -module using the same operations of addition and scaling as in .

Then for is a submodule of .    Let be an -module and be an ideal in . is an -submodule of .       Submodules and Zorn's Lemma   Let be a submodule of an -module . Using , prove that there is a submodule such that    , and     for every non-zero submodule of .       Qual Watch  Proving was on the qualifying exam.    Restriction of Scalars and Algebras    Restrictions will set you free.   W.A. Mathieu   For an -module the ring is often referred to as the ring of scalars for the module (by analogy to the vector space case). Given an action of a ring of scalars on a module, we can sometimes produce an action of a different ring of scalars on the same set, producing in effect a new module structure. ring of scalars   Restriction of Scalars   Let be a ring homomorphism. Any left -module may be regarded via restriction of scalars as a left -module with the following structure:   the rule for addition on is the same as in the original structure and    the rule for scaling by elements of is     restriction of scalars     Let and . One checks that the properties in the definition of module hold for the given action using properties of ring homomorphisms. In detail, since preserves addition, since preserves multiplication, and since preserves multiplicative identities. This gives three of the axioms. The final also holds:     As a special case of , if is a subring of , then every left -module becomes a left -module via restriction of scalars along the inclusion map of into . This explains the use of the phrase restriction of scalars . That being said, in generality the phrase translation of scalars would be more appropriate.  Algebra   Given a ring , an - algebra is a ring equipped with a ring homomorphism . This defines an -module structure on given by restriction of scalars: for each and , . This -module structure on is compatible with the internal multiplication of i.e., We will call the structure homomorphism of the -algebra . algebra  -algebra  structure homomorphism     Polynomial Rings are Algebras   If is a ring and are indeterminates, the inclusion map makes the polynomial ring into an -algebra.    Inclusion Maps Give Algebra Structure   More generally, any inclusion map gives an -algebra structure. In this case the -module multiplication coincides with the internal (ring) multiplication on .    Rings Have Unique Structure as -algebra   Any ring comes with a unique structure as a -algebra, since there is a unique ring homomorphism : the one given by .    Restrictions of Scalars     Complex Vector Spaces are Real  Since is a subring of , every complex vector space may be regarded as a real vector space, by restriction of scalars from to . Likewise, any real vector space may be regarded as a rational vector space, etc.   Polynomial Rings are Modules  The polynomial ring is a left -module for any via the evident injective ring homomorphism .     is a left -module for given by the ring map sending to .   is an -module  If is a (two-sided) ideal of a ring then applying restriction of scalars along the quotient homomorphism gives that any left -module is also a left -module. The rule for scaling is .           A is a generalization of the concept of a vector space to any ring of scalars.    Given a ring and an ideal , each of , , and can be viewed as -modules.     . This comes up quite often.    If a homomorphism exists between two rings, and , we can translate (or restrict) the scalars from one module to the next.     "

However, since all modules underlying groups are abelian, this condition is satisfied automatically.   Quotient Modules are Well Defined   Let be a ring, let be an -module, and let be a submodule of . The rule for scaling introduced above is well-defined and it, along with the rule for , makes into an -module.    Module Quotient Map   Let be a ring, let be an -module, and let be a submodule of .

We need to prove the rule for scaling by on is well-defined: If then so by the definition of submodule. This gives that , hence . The module axioms are then pretty straightforward. We already know from 817 CITEX that is an abelian group under .  Let us check one of the four axioms involving scaling. We have which gives the third such axiom. The other three are also straightforward.  The fact that is an -module homomorphism is also straightforward. Its kernel is , which is equal to .    -modules and Quotients  Recall that -modules are the same as abelian groups by .

Moreover, and preserve sums and intersections. lattice isomorphism theorem (for modules)        Ignoring the rules for scaling by , we know each of the first four results holds for abelian groups (and the maps are the same). So, we merely need to prove that the rules for scaling are respected in each case. In more detail:  UMP  From the , we already know that is a well-defined homomorphism of groups under and that it is the unique one such that . It remains only to show preserves scaling: where the third equation uses that preserves scaling.   First Isomorphism Theorem  From we already know that there is an isomorphism of abelian groups under , given by , and it remains only to show this map preserves scaling. This is a special case of what we proved in part (0).   Second Isomorphism Theorem  First, note from that and are indeed submodules. The yields an isomorphism of abelian groups given by . It remains only to show preserves scaling:    Third Isomorphism Theorem  For the third, we already know (from 817) that is a subgroup of under . Given and we have which belongs to since . This proves is a submodule of . Also from 817 we know there is an isomorphism of abelian groups given by and it remains only to show it is -linear:    Lattice Isomorphism Theorem  The Lattice Theorem is the most complicaed to gerenlize. From 817 we know thre is a bijection between the set of subgroups of and that contain and subgroups of the quotient group , and the maps are the same as given in the statment.

Mike Tyson   Where We Came From, Where We're Going  In , we learned about free groups and presentations, ways of representing groups in more digestible ways. Recall that a is essentially a way of creating a generic group from a specific set. These sets were the generators of the free group, which was called free due to the lack of relations, or combinations of elements that canceled out to the identity.  In the realm of modules, there are many similarites, such as the notion of a free module . Free modules are, essentially, ways of creating generic modules from specific sets. These sets are called the generators of the free module, Though, in the world of linear algebra and vector spaces, such sets are referred to as spanning sets . which is called free due to the lack of relations, or linear combinations of elements that cancel out to zero.  Every group has a , a set of generators and relations that express the structure of the group. This presentation can be obtained by starting with a free group and taking quotients corresponding to the relations between the generators. Thus, every group can be expressed as the quotient of a free group.  Similarly, we shall see that every module can be expressed as the quotient of a free module. Additionally, the concept of a presentation for a module exists as well, which we will explore in greater depth in .   Linear Combination   Let be an -module and .

Notice that a generating set always exists: for example, we can take , though of course that is a bit of an overkill, since it's quite likely that some elements can be obtained from linear combinations of others. Next, we construct a free module on the set ; more precisely, we take a free module on as many generators as generators for that we picked. Now the map   Notice this map actually makes sense: the tuples have only finitely many nonzero entries, and thus is a (finite) linear combination of our chosen generators. Moreover, since we chose the to be generators for , this map is surjective. It is also easy to check that it is an -module homomorphism: in fact, this is the -module homomorphism we would get from the by setting .  By the ,      Rank  Module Rank   Let be a non-zero commutative ring and let be a free -module. The cardinality of any basis of is called the rank of . rank (of an -module)     But what about if two bases have different ranks? As it turns out, any two bases of the same free module will have the same cardinality, as we will prove in . Mostly. The rest is proved in .   Rank of  The -module has rank . Thus has rank as a module over itself, as this is the case when .   Bases need not be finite.  Module with Infinite Basis  Let be any ring and (which, recall, is an -module due to the evident ring map ). Then the countably infinite set is a basis. The fact that this set is a basis is essentially part of the definition of . says that every polynomial is uniquely expressible as an -linear combination of (a finite subset of) .   Free Modules with Equal Basis Elements Isomorphic   If and are free -modules having bases of the same cardinality, then and are isomorphic -modules.     Let be a basis of and be a basis of such that . Thus there exists a bijection with inverse . We invoke the to build -module homomorphisms and such that for all and for all .  We'll show that and are mutual inverses. For this note that is an -module homomorphism and for every . Since the identity map is also an -module homomorphism such that for every , by the uniqueness clause in the , we have . Similarly .    as -modules  If is a free -module that has a basis of cardinality , then as -modules. This is because is a free module of rank , and thus by .     Beware that the cardinality of a basis of a free modules is not an isomorphism invariant in general! There exist rings such that and are isomorphic -modules for all positive integers and .

For any ideal of , as -modules.    https:\/\/eloisagrifo.github.io\/Teaching\/818\/PSet3solutions.pdf    Uniqueness of Rank over Commutative Rings   Let be a commutative ring such that and let be a free -module with bases and .

Since and are finite, by we have and .  I will prove this statement by taking it as already known that it holds in the special case when is a field. (We will prove it for fields later in .)  Since is not the zero ring, it contains at least one maximal ideal by . Recall that is a field by   Given an isomorphism of -modules, by Lemma we have an induced homomorphism of -module . Likewise, the inverse map induces a map . Also by that Lemma we have and similarly is the identity. That is, we have an isomorphism of -modules.  Next, I claim that there is an isomorphism of -modules. Define in the evident way (modding out by entry-wise). It is a surjective map of -modules with kernel and thus, by the , it induces an isomorphism given by (where denotes taking the transpose). Now, what we have said so far only shows that is isomorphism of -modules, but it is easy to see that is in fact -linear (I'll leave that to you) and thus it is an isomorphism of -modules.  Putting the results proven so far together, we conclude that and are isomorphic as -modules. Since is a field and since we are assuming the result holds for fields, we deduce that .     Checking the definition carefully, we see that both the empty set and the set form bases for the zero module over the ring. This gives an example of a module with two bases of different cardinalities, justifying why the suppostion that was used in .

In a free module with basis , every element of can be expressed uniquely as an -linear combination of elements in .

At first glance the most obvious choice would be , where is the sequence with a in the -th position and 's everywhere else.  However, this set does not span as can not be represented as a finite linear combination of these elements. (It turns out that is the basis for the direct sum , which may be identified with all sequences having only a finite number of non-zero terms.)  Now, since we know since is not in , we have that is a linearly independent set. However, this does not span either as is not in the span of this set. We know that has a basis, but it can be shown that no countable collection of vectors forms a basis for this space, in fact . An explicit basis of this vector space is impossible to describe.

  "body": "Finitely Presented Modules  Previously on Modern Algebra...    The success of your presentation will be judged not by the knowledge you send but by what the listener receives.   Lily Walters   When working with groups, we had the notion of the presentation of a group. We proved that every group was the quotient of a free group, where the presentation of the group was obtained by taking quotients corresponding to the relations of the presentation.  In the realm of modules, we have shown that . We also know that every free module of rank is isomorphic to . Thus, we can obtain a presentation for a module by taking quotients of corresponding to our relations, which are given in the form of a matrix (or equivalently by a homomorphism between a pair of free modules.)  Notation    The collection of all matrices with coefficients in       , , The , , and image of an -module homomorphism.    ,         Module Presentations  -Module Presentation   Let be a non-zero commutative ring, let , and let be the -module homomorphism represented by with respect to the standard bases; that is, define . The - module presented by  is the -module .  Equivalently, the module presented by is where are the columns of . presentation (of an -module)  -module presented by       The -module is presented by     Notice . Notice here we abused notation and wrote instead of the matrix .    Conversely, we might be given a matrix and ask about what module it represents; one thing to keep in mind is that some presentations might be inefficient, either by having more generators or more relations than necessary. We want to answer to key questions: given a presentation for a module, how to find a more efficient presentation; and how to decide if two different presentations actually give us isomorphic modules. Keeping these goals in mind, let's try a more elaborate example.  -Module Presentation   Consider the matrix What -module is presented by ?    Formally, is the quotient module , where is defined by . Since is generated by its standard basis elements , we deduce as in that is generated by the cosets of the . To keep the notation short, we set .  Let and note that is the submodule of generated by the columns of : Since maps to 0 under the quotient map , the relations of can be written as We can now see that this is a rather inefficient presentation, since we can clearly use the first equation to solve for for . This implies that can be generated using only and , that is This eliminates the first equation and the latter two become Now we can also eliminate , i.e leaving just two generators that satisfy   Another way to do this is to look at the matrix and use elementary row operations to \"make zeros\" on the 1st and 2nd columns, as follows:   Eliminating the generators and amounts to dropping the first two columns (which are the 3rd and 4th standard basis vectors) as well as the last two rows. As we will prove soon, this shows that the -module presented by is isomorphic to the -module presented by     We can go further. Set . Then and also form a generating set of . The relation on translates to     given by the matrix     Note that we have done a row operation (subtract twice row 1 from row 2 ) to get from to . Continuing in this fashion by subtracting 12 row 2 from row 1 we also form     The last matrix presents the module with generators , where     and relation . This module is isomorphic to our original module . As we will see, this proves . An explicit isomorphism between and is given by sending by the unique -module homomorphism defined by     Now notice that the kernel of this homomorphism is the submodule . Then the first isomorphism theorem gives .    Matrices, Modules, and Isomorphisms   Let be a non-zero commutative ring and let and for some . Then and present isomorphic -modules if can be obtained from by any finite sequence of operations of the following form:   an elementary row operation,    an elementary column operation,    deletion of the -th column and -th row of a matrix whose -th column is the vector ,    the reverse of (3),    deletion of a column of all 's,    the reverse of (5).       Note: This proof was not covered in class. Assume is obtained from by a single one of the steps listed above. We need to prove that there is an isomorphism of -modules.   In this case, for some elementary matrix . More generally, let be any invertible matrix such that . Then is an isomorphism and it maps bijectively onto . It follows that the kernel of the composition is and hence by the first isomorphism theorem it induces an isomorphism     In this case, for some elementary matrix . More generally, assume is any invertible matrix such that . Since is an isomorphism, we have and so . (For this one we get equality, not merely an isomorphism.)    For notational simplicity, let us assume ; that is, the first column of is and is obtained by deleting the first row and column of , giving a matrix. So where denotes some row vector and denotes a column of all 's. Let and be projection onto the last and components, respectively. Because of the nature of and , the diagram (page 40 in notes) commutes. Moreover, the kernel of is and the kernel of is , and since the first column of is , maps the kernel of bijectively onto the kernel of . A “diagram chase'' shows that . In detail: Since the diagram commutes, and hence induces an -module homomorphism (by the -th isomorphism theorem). Since is onto, so is . Suppose . So, . Say . Since is onto, for some . Then and thus . As noted above, maps onto and hence for some vector . This proves and hence that in . This proves is one-to-one.    The columns of generate the same submodule of as do the columns of , and thus and .    Since the isomorphism relation is reflexive, the statements of parts 3. & 5. show that parts 4.& 6. are true as well.        The converse is true for some rings , including Euclidean domains.    In fact, if and are equivalent matrices, then , as I shall prove below. This implies both (1) and (2) from the Theorem.   Diagonal Presentation   Suppose is a commutative ring and is a matrix such that for all and set for all . If then and if then     Assume and define to be the map sending to where for . (I.e., is the unique -map sending the -th standard basis vector to with in the -th position, for , and to itself for .) Then is clearly onto and the kernel of is the set of those tuples such that for some for all and for . Given such a tuple, This proves is contained Arguing backwards we see that the opposite containment also holds, so that in fact .  By the , If then, by deleting columns of all 's, we may reduce to the case when , which is included in the first case.     When Modules are Finitely Presented: Noetherian Rings    A chain is no stronger than its weakest link.   William James    We now address the question of which modules have finite presentations. Any such module must be finitely generated (since the cosets of generate for any matrix ). If is finitely generated, say by elements, then we can find a surjective -module homomorphism Provided the kernel of is also finitely generated, say by elements, then we may find a surjection The composition is a map between free -modules and is thus equal to for some matrix . Then and hence by the  so that is finitely presented.  So the real question is: For a given ring , is it the case that for all , every submodule of is finitely generated? The answer is \"no\" in general, but it does hold for many rings of interest:   Noetherian Rings   Suppose is a commutative ring. The following conditions are equivalent:    has the ascending chain condition on ideals.    Every ideal of is finitely generated — i.e., for every ideal , there exists a finite set of elements in such that . In this case we say is noetherian .       Assume every ideal is finitely generated and that such a chain is given. Let . For we have for some and hence .  If , then and for some and hence there is a such that . It follows that . Finally . Thus is an ideal. Thus by assumption is finitely generated, say for some .  Each belongs to one of the 's and hence, since there are only a finite number of such elements and ideas are nested, there is an such that . It follows that and hence .  Assume has the acc for ideals and let be any ideal. Pick any element and set . If we are done. If not, pick and set . If we are done and if not pick and let . In this way we form a strictly ascending chain , and this process cannot be continued forever since has the acc. When it terminates, we have for some and thus is finitely generated.    Finitely Generated Modules in Noetherian Rings   If is a noetherian commutative ring, then every submodule of a finitely generated module is again finitely generated.    I will just prove the following special case (since it is all we need): For each , every submodule of is finitely generated. The base case holds by definition (and Lemma ), since a submodule of is the same thing as an ideal.  Assume and the result holds for . Let be any submodule of . Define to be the projection onto the last component of . The kernel of may be identified with and so is a submodule of , and it is therefore finitely generated by assumption. The image of under is a submodule of , that is, an ideal of , and so it too is finitely generated by assumption (and Lemma ).  Furthermore, by the first isomorphism theorem is also finitely generated. By a homework problem, we deduce that is a finitely generated module.  % I'll just sketch the general case (which I don't think we'll actually need): let be any finitely generated -module and any submodule. % Since is finitely generated, there exists a surjective -module homomorphism for some . Then is a submodule of and % hence it is finitely generated by the case we already proved. Moreover, induces a surjective -module homomorphism , % and hence is isomorphic to a quotient of a finitely generated -module and thus it is also finitely generated.    The converse is also true.   If is not noetherian, there there exists an ideal that is not finitely generated (by ). This gives an example of a non-finitely-generated submodule, namely , of a finitely generated module, namely .   Finite Presentations in Noetherian Rings   Any finitely generated module over a noetherian ring has a finite presentation; that is, given such a module over such a ring, there exists an matrix in and an isomorphism     We basically already proved this, but let me recap it:  If is finitely generated, then for some we can find a surjective -module homomorphism Since we assume is noetherian, the kernel of is also finitely generated by , and so we may find a surjection of -modules for some . The composition is equal to for some matrix . Since , the gives an isomorphism                 A ring is noetherian if and only if every submodule of a finitely generated module is finitely generated.    In a noetherian ring, all finitely generated -modules are finitely presented.     "

Notice moreover that if is an invertible matrix, then so is   To construct a matrix in the form above, let be the upper left entry of . First, we are going to show that we can turn into a matrix of the form with the same gcd as . If a happens to divide all the entries on the first row and column, then we can simply apply elementary row and column operations to get to the desired form. Suppose there exists on the first column such that . Then we may apply an elementary row operation switching rows so that is on the first column, second row. By , we can now find an invertible matrix such that   Consider the matrix Note that has and , so this step replaces by and by 0 . By , . We can keep repeating this until the top left corner entry divides every entry on the first column, and this process must stop after at most steps, since there are only elements on the first column.  Similarly, if there exists on the first row that does not divide, we can repeat this process by instead multiplying on the left by an invertible matrix, until we zero out all the remaining entries on the first row and column. Finally, we arrive at a matrix of the form   If , we are done. If not, then we can find some entry such that . We can then add the th column to the first column, which puts into the first column without affecting , since the remainder of the top row is zero. But this brings us back to the previous situation, and we have already shown that we can replace the top left corner by .  At each step, we replace by some with is both a divisor of and a multiple of . Our ring is a UFD, so there are finitely many factors of , and this process must stop. This shows that we can eventually replace by   Now it remains to show the uniqueness portion of the theorem. For any and any matrix , let denote the gcd of all the minors of . By , is unchanged by row and column operations, so .  For a matrix of the form , the only minors that are nonzero are those where the choices of columns and rows are the same, and hence the only nonzero minors of are for some . Since divide each other, it follows that   In particular, the largest value of such that some minor of is nonzero is . Also, we have   This proves uniqueness, for it shows that are all defined from directly, without any choices.     Note that some of the diagonal entries could be . Recall for all (including ), and is the only element that divides . So, the “tail'' end of the sequence could be all 's, and indeed if for some then all subsequent diagonal entries must be .   Elementary row and column operations correspond to multiplication by elementary matrices, which are invertible, and that the composition of invertible matrices is invertible. So whenever we apply elementary row and column operations, we can translate it into multiplication by an invertible matrix on the left or the right, respectively.  To transform a matrix into its Smith Normal Form, we will use a sequence of steps that all correspond to multiplication by invertible matrices. Many of those steps will actually be elementary row and column operations, which correspond to multiplication by an elementary matrix. Elementary matrices are invertible, and a product of invertible matrices is invertible, and so any finite sequence of elementary row and column operations can be described by multiplication by an invertible matrix. However, in general not every invertible matrix can be obtained as a product of elementary matrices. In fact, there are examples of PIDs and matrices for which the Smith Normal Form cannot be obtained by simply taking a sequence of elementary row and column operations. However, it is not easy to give such an example, in part because when our PID is nice enough, the Smith Normal Form can in fact be obtained by simply taking a sequence of elementary row and column operations. This is the case for Euclidean domains: over such rings, the Euclidean Algorithm for finding the gcd of two elements works, and it's the key step we will need to find a Smith Normal Form. When is a general PID, however, we need to work a little harder.  Special Case of SNF  Suppose is a Euclidean domain and is a matrix. Column operations of type I in this case amount to adding a multiple of one element in this list to another one. The SNF Theorem in this case amounts to the Euclidean algorithm: By adding a suitable multiple of the one entry in the first two positions to the other, in the usual back-and-forth way, we arrive at where . Repeat this for columns and to arrive at where . Continuing in this fashion we arrive at where .  The proof of the SNF Theorem in general amounts to an extended version of the idea used in this special case.   Finding SNF  Consider the matrix with entries in  Do row and column operations to put into its Smith Normal Form: Conclude that the module presented by is isomorphic to .    Proof and Uniqueness of Smith Normal Form    Let be a PID and let . The greatest common divisor or gcd of , denoted , is a generator for the principal ideal . Given a matrix is the gcd of the entries of . We adopt the convention that and thus if is the matrix of all zeroes, then . (in a PID)  greatest common divisor (in a PID)  (of a matarix)  greatest common divisor (of a matrix)      Notice that the greatest common divisor is only defined up to multiplication by a unit.   Matrix GCDs in PIDs   Let is a PID. Let be any matrix and let and be invertible matrices. Then . In particular, if and is obtained from by a finite sequence of elementary row and column operations, then .    First, suppose that , meaning that is a column, say We need to show that . On the one hand, each is a linear combination of the , so . On the other hand, so each is a combination of the , and . We conclude that we have an equality of ideals , and thus multiplying a column vector by an invertible matrix does not change the greatest common divisor of the entries.  Now given , if we denote the th column of by , we have Since the gcd of each column remains the same, the gcd of all the entries does not change.  To show that , note that transposing a matrix does not change its gcd nor the fact that its invertible, so we can apply what we have already shown:   Finally, applying elementary row and column operations corresponds to multiplying by an elementary matrix on the left or right, and elementary matrices are invertible.    Matrix GCD of Ring Elements   Let be a PID and . There exists an invertible matrix such that     By definition of greatest common divisor, , so there exist such that . Write and . Then is a multiple of , but since and is a domain, we conclude that must be a unit, and . In particular, we can find such that . Finally, , so   Now we can apply the row operation that adds times the first row to the second row: by setting we get   Finally, one can easily check that     By transposing the matrices in , we can show that there exists an invertible matrix such that   Minor   A  minor of is the determinant of a submatrix of ; more formally, if is an matrix, a minor of is any element of given as follows: Choose and , let be the matrix with . Then is a minor of . minor (of a matrix)     Ideals Generated by Minors   For any commutative ring and matrix , if is obtained from via an elementary column or column operation, then the ideal of generated by all the minors of equals the ideal of generated by all the minors of .    Smith Normal Form is Unique   Assume is a PID and . Suppose can be obtained from via a sequence of elementary column and column operations and that is diagonal with diagonal entries such that . Then In particular, the SNF of a matrix is unique up to associates.    Recall that for a PID , the gcd of any set of elements is defined to be a generatpr of the ideal they generate. So, implies that for all . Since is diagonal, the only non-zero minors of are those given by indices and for which for all , and moreover such a minor is equal to . Since for all , it follows that divides for all . Thus , for each , and hence as claimed.     So, another way of finding the SNF of a matrix with entries in a Euclidean domain is to calculate for all . This is not practical except in very special cases.       The Smith Normal Form of a matrix is analogous to the row-echelon form and reduced row-echelon form in the case of matrices over a field.    The Smith Normal Form of a matrix is unique, up to associates.             "

Fyodor Dostoevsky    Making Transformations into Modules  Given a vector space over a field, we can finagle it into an module instead. As is a field, is a PID, and thus we can use the Fundamental Theorem CITEX to decompose it into a quotient by a direct sum of polynomials. These polynomials are the invariant factors of the module.  Endomorphisms and Linear Operators   Let be an -module. An -module homomorphism from to itself is known as an endomorphism . In the case where is a field and a vector space, is known as a linear operator .

Suppose is a field and is a -module. By restriction of scalars along the canonical ring map we may regard as a -vector space — let us write this vector space as to be precise. Let be the map given by . Then is an -linear operator on . So, to a -module we may associate the pair where is an -vector space and is an -linear operator on . This process is reversible:   -Module   Let be a field, let be a finite dimensional vector space over , and let be an -linear operator. The -module is defined to be the abelian group equipped with the rule for scaling given by for any polynomial and vector . -module      is Actually a -Module   Given a pair as in the definition, really is a -module.    Special Case of  We have the following special case (it isn't really special — the general case reduces to this one upon choosing a basis):  Given a matrix , then is the -module whose underlying abelian group is (column vectors) with the usual rule for addition and with the rule for scaling given by for any column vector . For short, we write this rule as for any polynomial , where is the matrix obtained by evaluating at in the evident sense.     Let and let be the -module . So as a -vector space, and acts on by sending to . I claim there is an isomorphism of -modules.    Let . Note that and that and span as a -vector space. It follows that generates as a -module; in detail, for any we have .  Define a -module homomorphism by sending to and hence to . It is onto since generates as a -module. The kernel will be a (necessarily principle) ideal of ; we just need to find it. Note that , and are linearly dependent and in fact we have and hence . This gives that is in the kernel of and hence, by the -th Isomorphism Theorem we have an induced homomorphism of -modules induced by . The map is onto since is onto. Since the source and target both have dimension two as -vector spaces, is -linear, and is onto, it must in fact be an isomorphism of -modules (by the Rank-Nullity Theorem CITEX).    Equality of -Modules   The two assignments and defined above are mutually inverse: Given a -module , there is an equality of -modules and given a pair with an -vector space and an -linear operator on we have an equality of pairs . equality of -modules      In fact, these rules determine an “isomorphism of categories'', whatever that means.

Moreover, this matrix is unique, and is known as the rational canonical form of the operator .    We know by the Fundamental Theorem of modules over (i.e., Corollary ) that there is a -module isomorphism for some unique list of monic, non-constant polynomials with for all . Recall that the operator on is given as (multiplication by ) on . Since this is a -module isomorphism, corresponds to multiplication by on each summand . As we have seen before, for each , the matrix representing on relative to the basis of is the companion matrix of . Let be the -basis of given by tuples (in that order). Then the matrix of on for is .  This gives existence. Uniqueness is a consequence of the uniqueness of the list , but I will omit the details.     The matrix is unique, but the basis that realizes it is, in general, not unique. As an extreme example illustrating this: Take to be the identity operator on a finite dimensional vector space . Then holds for any basis . (Note that is indeed in rational canonical form: it is equal to .)

By the way, tracking through the calculations that got us here, we see that the basis of that gives the RCF of if of .   Every Matrix Similar to Unique RCF Matrix   Every matrix is similar to a unique matrix in RCF.    Similarity Classes of Matrices   Let be the field with elements for some prime . Up to similarity, how many matrices are there with entries in ?    Each such matrix is similar to a unique one of the form with monic polynomials of positive degree such that . Moreover, since is a matrix where , we must have . So the goal becomes to count all such tuples of polynomials. We proceed by cases on . Note that is not possible.  Case  Then and the number of such polynomials is (since and has elements).   Case  Note that is not possible. If then , and there are possibilities. If , then and with monic and .

The total is         The proof of Theorem CITEX makes clear the following fact: For a field , finite dimensional vector space , and -linear operator ,the invariant factors of the operator are identical to the invariant factors of the -module .   The following result is thus very useful for finding the Rational Canonical Form of an operator (we will state it just for operators given explicitly by matrices):  RCF and Cokernels   Let be a field and let . The matrix presents the -module ; that is, there is an isomorphism of -modules     For this proof it is useful to identity with where the latter refers to all expressions of the form with .

Since is -linear it is certainly -linear. Since , to prove is one-to-one, it suffices to prove (by Rank-Nullity). I claim the images of the standard basis in span it as an -vector space. To see this, note that , for , span as an -vector space, and hence they span the quotient. It thus suffices to show lies in the span of in for all and . We have and thus and by repeating this argument we have     Invariant Factors are Diagonal SNF Entries   The invariant factors of a matrix are the non-zero, non-unit diagonal entries of the SNF of .    Let be the Smith Normal Form of and let be its diagonal entries. As proven before, the matrix and present isomorphic -modules, and thus the Theorem gives an isomorphism Since , none of the 's can be zero. So, each is monic and . Now some of the might be non-zero constants, in which case is a unit and . Upon tossing those out, we are left with with each monic of positive degree and . These are, by definition, the invariant factors of .    Once More to Back to   Let's find the invariant factors of the matrix we looked at before, but this time using the and .

Finding IFs and RCF   Let Let us find the invariant factors and Rational Canonical Form of by finding the Smith Normal Form of .

It follows that the matrix of this operator relative to the ordered basis is and hence the matrix for itself for this basis is This is what's known as a Jordan Block .    In this example, if we used the basis instead we would have gotten the transpose of .   Jordan Block  Jordan block   Given a field , and integer , and an element , the Jordan block  is the with entries in such that its diagonal entries are all , each entry just below the diagonal is a , and all other entries are : (More precisely, for all , for all , and for all other .)     Some people (including I think the authors or our text) defined a Jordan block to be the transpose of what I have defined it to be.   Jordan Canonical Form  Jordan canonical form (JCF)   Let be a field, let be a finite dimensional -vector space, and let be a linear transformation satisfying the property that the characteristic polynomial of factors completely in into linear factors. Then there is an ordered basis for such that where , the 's, and the 's are such that are the elementary divisors of the -module . Moreover, this matrix is unique up to ordering of the Jordan Blocks.    The proof is similar to the proof the RCF theorem, using the idea of Example CITEX above, but starting with the FTFGMPIDEDF CITEX(instead of the FTFGMPIDIFF). Here are the details:  We consider the -module . Since we assume factors completely, the only irreducible polynomials in its factorization are linear. Thus the invariant factors of are products of polynomials of the form for various and integers . It follows that the elementary divisors have this form too. The FTFGMPIDEDF CITEX therefore gives an isomorphism of -modules Now pick ordered bases for each of the summands and set to be their “ordered union'' just as we did for the proof of the Theorem on RCF. CITEX By the same argument as in Example CITEX applied to each summand individually, the matrix representing multiplication by on each summand is . This gives the existence of the JCF.  The uniqueness follows from the uniqueness clause in the FTFGMPIDEDF CITEX.     Not every operator has a Jordan Canonical Form: only applies if factors completely, and, conversely, if an operator is represented by any lower-triangular matrix, then its characteristic polynomial must be a product of linear polynomials. For algebraically closed fields, such as , every linear operator does indeed have a JCF.    If we flip the order of each in the proof, we would end up with the transpose of what I have defined the JCF to be. This is what our text does, and it defines the JCF as the transpose of what I have defined it to be.   JCF Exists if CharPoly Factors Linearly   If is an matrix with entries in a field and factors completely into linear factors, then is similar to a matrix in Jordan Canonical Form, and this matrix is unique up to the ordering of the Jordan Blocks.

Note that a diagonal matrix is an example of a matrix in JCF. By the uniqueness of the JCF, (1) holds if and only if (2) holds. Moreover, the equivalence of (2) and (3) follows by definition. A matrix has a JCF if and only if its invariant factors factor completely. In this case, the elementary divisors are constructed by decomposing each invariant factor into powers of distinct linear polynomials. This gives that (3) holds if and only if (4) holds. Finally, since the minimal polynomial is one of the invariant factors and every other invariant factor divides it, we get the equivalence between (4) and (5).                        "

  "title": "Field Extension Basics",
  "body": "Field Extension Basics  Welcome to Field Extensions    Give me extension and motion and I will construct the universe.   René Descartes   One motivation for studying field extensions is that we want to build fields in which certain polynomials have roots. Here is a classical example going back to Gauss: while over the polynomial has no roots, if we want a field in which does have a root we need to consider .  Starting from a smaller field and an irreducible polynomial , we want to build a larger field . One way to do this is to take a root of and adjoin it to obtaining the field , which is the collection of all expressions that one can build using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division starting from the of elements of . Another way to build a larger field from a smaller field and an irreducible polynomial is to let . We will show below that these two ways of creating larger fields are one and the same.  Field Extension   A field extension is an inclusion of one field into a larger field , making into a subfield of . We will write either or to signify that is a field extension of . field extension  extension (of fields)      Recall that if and are fields, then every ring homomorphism necessarily injective. (Proof: since , is a proper ideal of , and since is a field, the only proper ideal of it is .) Thus maps isomorphically onto its image and is a field extension. By abuse of notation we will typically think of as being a field extension, even though it is technically just an injective homomorphism of fields.   Field Extensions   and are basic examples of field extensions.  Recall CITEX that is a field. So is another example of a field extension.    The latter is a typical sort of example for us: Starting with , we would like to adjoin a root of the irreducible (in ) polynomial . Doing so yields .   The previous example was a quadratic extension, which is misleadingly simple.  Yet More Field Extensions  Consider . It is irreducible (e.g., by ) and has roots , and in . So there are three ways in which we could “adjoin a root\" to : First we could form the field It is not completely obvious this is a field, but we'll prove it later. The reason that we don't need third or higher powers is that, e.g., . Or we could instead form the field or the field . There are not all equal since, for example, but is not in . However, they are {} field extensions as we will prove below.   Let us formalize some of these definitions:    Given a field extension and an element , set Then is a subring of and in fact it is the smallest subring of that contains and . We define to be the smallest subfield of that contains and .   adjoining an element      We read as adjoin .   Intersection of Subfields  Show that exists by proving that the intersection of any two subfields is again a subfield.   In some cases we have .  When  Prove whenever is the root of some polynomial with coefficients in .     If is a field extension and , the field is the fraction field of : more precisely,     Soon we will give an even better description for in the case where is the root of a polynomial .  is a Field  Take and . Then any expression of the form with is equal to one of the form for . If , then with and both in . This proves that and in particular that is a field.   is not a Field   is not a field, and so in particular it is not equal to since, for example, . (If it were, then we would have for some , and hence , which would imply is the root of a polynomial with rational coefficients. This is known to be not true.)    Degree of a Field Extension    I may not have a degree, but I certainly got an education.   Jodi Picoult   Degree of a Field Extension   The degree of a field extension is  degree (of a field extension)     Degrees of Common Extensions  We have that and . (We could in fact say is the cardinality of , but in general we lump all infinite field extensions together when talking about degree.) We have where .   Properties of Extension Degrees   Assume is a field and is an irreducible polynomial. Set , and for , let denote the coset . The following hold:    is a field extension via the map given by for . (This is technically an injective homomorphisms of fields.)     .     has a root in ; in fact, the element is a root of this polynomial: .       Because is irreducible and is a PID, is a maximal ideal CITEX. Thus is a field CITEX. The map given by is a ring map since it is the composition of the two ring maps  . Since it is a ring map between two fields, it is injective CITEX.  The equality holds since is a basis for regarded as an -vector space, as we have seen before .  The last assertion is tricky only because the notation is confusing. Say and just to keep things straight let's set . We need to show : We have     The last part of the proposition is notationally confusing to prove in general but clear in examples.   Say and . Then . The assertion is that is a root of the polynomial viewed as having coefficients in . In other words, this element has the property that its square is . Let's check: Since and we have . Indeed, there is a field isomorphism sending to and more generally to .    Simple and Generated Extensions    It's not easy, but it's simple.   Eric Thomas   Simple Extension, Primitive Element   A field extension is called simple if for some element of . We call such an a primitive element for the extension. simple field extension  primative element       is a primitive element of the extension . So is and, more generally, for any with .    If is a simple field extension, note that there might be many different elements such that . Thus primitive elements are not necessarily unique.   We can generalize this to adjoining a subset instead of a single element.  Generated Subfield   If is a field extension and is any subset of , the subfield generated by over , denoted , is the smallest subfield of that contains all of . If is a finite set, we write for . generated subfield  subfield generated by      Regard as a subfield of and let . We may also describe as where we set .  I claim that is in fact a simple extension of . For example, say . I claim that . Note that and So , and hence . Likewise, So . This example shows is simple and is a primitive element of this field extension.    This example is an illustration of the Primitive Element Theorem (which we might or might not have time to prove this semester): Every finite extension of is generated by a single element (or, in other words, is simple).    Uniqueness of Simple Extensions    Feeling unique is no indication of uniqueness.   Douglas Coupland   Next we will show that if is a root of a given polynomial , then is determined by up to isomorphism.    Let be a field extension and let be an irreducible polynomial. If has a root , then there is an isomorphism with and     Let be the evaluation homomorphism that sends ; more precisely, , and the restriction of this map to is the identity on . Since , we have , and since is a maximal ideal and , we conclude that .  Now by Theorem 1.43 we get an injective ring homomorphism such that .  It remains to be shown that is surjective. We will actually show more, namely that . Note first that by the definition of above, the image of on is . However, since is injective the image of is a field contained in , and since the smallest field containing is , we must in fact have .    Let's formalize the extra information we have obtained in the course of proving the theorem. First we used the following useful fact:   If is an injective ring homomorphism and and are fields then the image of is a subfield of .     Let be a field extension and let be irreducible having a root . Then .    Uniqueness of   Let be irreducible and let and be two roots of in some extensions and of . Then , so that the two roots are algebraically indistinguishable.    Complex Conjugation   Taking with roots and in , we actually obtain equal fields . But gives that there is an interesting isomorphism that sends to . In general, we have for .      Another example illustrating is that and are isomorphic fields. In fact, the are equal: . But again Corollary 5.25 CITEX gives that there is an interesting isomorphism that sends to . In general, we have for .     Let (the unique real cube-root of ) and (one of the two imaginary cube roots of ).  Then by (applied with ) there is an isomorphism of fields that restricts to the identity map on . Note that these two fields are not equal since the former is contained in and the latter is not.   The two examples above preview the central idea of Galois theory.   "

Then is a group under composition of maps, and is a subgroup of .    I claim has two elements (and so is a cyclic group of order ): the identity map on and the element given as complex conjugation. Each of these is an element of — for , this amounts to the fact that complex conjugation commutes with addition and multiplication of complex numbers (and that it sends to ).  To see these are the only elements of , suppose . For any , we have since . Moreover, and so . Thus or .

Then the gives that there is an induced ring homomorphism such that for each , we have If and , then .   By assumption, is a homomorphism and it restricts to the identity on . Thus for any polynomial , we have     If is a root of , then showing that is also a root of .       We now come to the main idea connecting field extensions and groups. It concerns the action of the group of automorphisms of a splitting field of a polynomial on the set of roots of that polynomial.  Acts on Roots   Let be the splitting field of a polynomial . Let be the set of distinct roots of in , and let .   The group acts faithfully on , via for all and , and hence is isomorphic to a subgroup of .    If is an irreducible polynomial, then acts transitively on .          Let . To see that the the action above is well-defined, notice that if then by Lemma 6.10. Now we have so the given formula does indeed define an action of on .  This action is faithful: if fixes all the roots of , then it fixes every element of . Thus the corresponding group homomorphism is injective. On the other hand, the group of automorphisms on a set of elements is isomorphic to , so we have an inclusion of into , and thus is isomorphic to a subgroup of .    Let be any two roots of . By Theorem 5.69, there is an isomorphism that fixes .  Our polynomial factors both as and . Since and , we must have . Theorem 5.69 applies, showing there is an automorphism that extends . In particular, fixes , since extends and , so . Moreover, since extends we have . This proves the action is transitive on the set of roots of any irreducible polynomial.       Soon we will show that if is separable but not necessarily irreducible, and is the splitting field of , then the orbits of the action of on the set of roots of are precisely the sets of roots of the same irreducible factor of . But to do so, we will need a little bit of Galois theory.    Let be the splitting field of a polynomial with distinct roots. Then .    We showed in that is isomorphic to a subgroup of , and thus it as at most elements.    We will give an improved version of this result soon.   Let be a field and , where are elements in some extension of that are algebraic over . Each element is uniquely determined by .   A typical question that arises from is to explicitly identify the automorphisms of a splitting field extension as a subgroup of the symmetric group.  and  For a more complicated example, let be the splitting field of over . Recall  Let us ponder how big could be. Pick any . Since is a ring homomorphism, for any we have and thus is also a root of . In other words, for each we have for some . Moreover, since is generated as a field extension of by , the action of on the three roots completely determines the action of on all of . In more detail, every element of is given taking -linear combinations of sums and products and quotients of these roots, and any element of preserves sums, products and -linear combinations.  To summarize, we have proven that there are {} possibilities for . In fact, more is true: The function given by sending to its restriction to the subset is an injective group homomorphism. Thus is isomorphic to a subgroup of . I claim that and hence . I will prove this directly - we will learn of fancier methods to do so later.  First we notice that the field automorphism of given by complex conjugation, namely , permutes the roots of and hence it restricts to a field map from into . Since this map is -linear and injective (as are all field maps) and is a finite dimensional -vector space, this map must be onto as well. So, we obtain an element given by for all . It corresponds .  Next, we apply , which gives such that . So, in the numbering above, corresponds to either or in . We don't really know which of these it is. (In fact, both will occur — the map is not unique.) But either way we have proven the claim: For notice that both subsets and of generated all of .  In other words, every possible permutation of roots of arises as a field automorphism of its splitting field over . This is what I meant before when I said that the roots of are “as symmetric as possible''.   and  Let be the splitting field of the irreducible polynomial . So where . By , the action of on is faithful so that we have an injective group homomorphism .  Note that this map cannot possibly be onto: there is no such that , , , and ; i.e., the permutation of these roots is not realizable by a field automorphism. To see this note that if then . So, any field automorphism that interchanges and would have to also interchange and . In fact, as we shall see, , considerably smaller than .  Let us compute . Note that since and in fact . In the chain of extensions the first one has degree , since is irreducible by , and the second has degree at most since is a root of . It would be less than two if factors in . But since and is not contained in , the second extension cannot be trivial and so must have degree exactly . We conclude . It follows from Proposition that . (In fact, since is the splitting field of a separable polynomial, the Theorem below will tell us that . But we won't appeal to this fact here.)  We claim and is isomorphic to the subgroup of generated by and . (This is isomorphic to .)  The map given by complex conjugation permutes the roots of and it restricts to an automorphism of — specially, it fixes and interchanges and . It follows that complex conjugation determines an element that corresponds to .  By the we get . Since , the degree of must be . This shows that must remain irreducible as a polynomial in ; this is not obvious, but we have now proven it, and this fact will be useful in what we do next.  To construct another element of , we use that that is the splitting field of the polynomial over and that, as we just showed, is irreducible in . We may thus apply Porism (also stated in the Corollary) to get that there is an element such that . We may regard as an element of since, by definition, is a subgroup of . We have since by construction. A key point here is that if we had merely specified to be an element of sending to , then we would have no idea what does to — it was key to define as we did. We then also get and . So corresponds to the permutation .  We have proven that is isomorphic to a subgroup of having order at most (by the Proposition above) and that it contains and . Since the subgroup generated by these two elements has order , the claim follows.    Finite Extensions and Galois Groups  We will now focus on finite field extensions and their automorphism groups. We start by giving a much better upper bound on the order of the automorphism group of a finite field extension.  Order and Degree   Let be a finite field extension. Then If is the splitting field of a separable polynomial in , then     We proceed by induction on . In the base case, , and thus , so is the trivial group, and both statements hold.  Now let and suppose that holds for all and such that . Let . Pick and let , and consider .  Note that is a proper subgroup of . By induction, we have . We claim that it suffices to prove . Indeed, using the Degree Formula and the fact that , if then   To show that , consider the function   By , for any the element is also a root of . For any , we have   Thus is well-defined. Moreover, for any we have which is equivalent to saying that fixes , and equivalently This proves that the function is injective.  By Theorem  . Thus is an inclusion of into a set with at most many elements. Therefore, Now suppose that is separable, so that with for and .  Set and let be the irreducible factor of that has as a root. Notice . As before, we consider and set . Note that is also the splitting field of over , and is also separable. By induction , and it remains to show that   Since is separable, so is , so is exactly the number of distinct roots of . Showing that amounts to the assertion that the injective map is also surjective. This holds since acts transitively on the roots of , as shown in .    The finite field extensions whose automorphism group is as large as possible are very important, and are the main subject of this final chapter.  Galois Extension   A finite field extension is Galois if . In this case we write for , and say is the Galois group of over . Galois field extension  Galois group     not Galois  I claim is not a Galois extension of . Let be the set of all roots of in . Since , has just one element: . Since , the function is injective by Proposition CITEX and so since , we have . Thus it isn't Galois. Since it is separable, must not be a normal extension of .    tells us how to construct Galois extensions:  First Construction of Galois Extensions from Splitting Fields   If is the splitting field of a separable polynomial , then is Galois.    Galois Extension   is a Galois extension of , since it the splitting field of . We proved above that has six elements and , as the Theorem predicts.   Galois and Characteristic  Let be a field of characteristic , for a prime integer , and assume is a finite field extension of such that there exists an element of with but . Then is not Galois since in this case.   We will need the following notation.  Fixed Subfield   If is subgroup of , the subfield of fixed by , denoted , is by definition  fixed subfield  subfield fixed by       Some textbooks write this as .    If is subgroup of , show that is a subfield of .     Let .

Michael Jordan    The Fundamental Theorem: Statement and Uses  Intermediate Field   Given a field extension , an intermediate field is a subfield of that contains , so that . intermediate field     Intermediate Extensions are Galois   If is a (finite) Galois extension, then so is for any intermediate field .    If is the splitting field over of a separable polynomial , then is also the splitting field over of the same polynomial, now regarded as belonging to .     In the setting of the , need not be Galois over .      is Galois over but is not Galois over .    Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory  fundamental theorem of Galois theory (FTGT)  Galois correspondance   Suppose is a (finite) Galois field extension. Then the functions given by is a bijection whose inverse is given by Moreover, this bijective correspondence enjoys the following properties:    and each reverse the order of inclusions.     and convert degrees of extensions to indices of subgroups:    or, equivalently,     .       Normal subgroups correspond to intermediate fields that are Galois over :   If then is Galois.    If is Galois, then .       If for a normal subgroup , then .    If are subgroups of with corresponding fixed subfields and , then    and      and .          First, we need to check that both functions are well-defined. For each intermediary field , we know from Corollary 6.31 that is also Galois, and hence it makes sense to write ; moreover, any is an automorphism of that fixes , and thus , so . This shows that is well-defined. Conversely, given a subgroup of is a subfield of by Exercise 18.  Next, we need to check that and are indeed inverse functions. Given a subgroup of , we have by Artin's Theorem. Thus Conversely, given an intermediate field is Galois by Corollary 6.31, and hence by Corollary 6.24. Thus This establishes the fact that is indeed a bijective correspondence.  Now we check that satisfies the given list of properties. For brevity, set .   The fact that the correspondence is order reversing follows from the definitions. Given intermediate fields , any automorphism of that preserves must also preserve , thus . Conversely, if , then every that is fixed by every must also be fixed in particular by every element of , so .    By definition of Galois extension, . By Artin's Theorem, for any subgroup the extension is also Galois, and thus by definition . Using the Degree Formula, we have So if , then and the formula above can be rewritten as     Suppose is an intermediate field that is Galois over . Fix and . Since is Galois, by Corollary 6.26 the polynomial is separable and all of its roots are in . By Lemma is also a root of , and thus .  Suppose . For any we have , so . Thus   This proves that and hence that . We have shown that if is Galois over , then the corresponding subgroup of is normal.  For the converse, consider a normal subgroup and the corresponding intermediate field , so that . We will show that is the splitting field over of a separable polynomial in , and hence is Galois over by Corollary 6.18.  Pick any and set . By Corollary 6.26, is separable and all of its roots belong to . We claim that all the roots must in fact belong to . Since is irreducible and is Galois, by Corollary acts transitively on the set of roots of . Thus, given be any other root of , there is a with . Since is normal, for any we have for some . But fixes , so . Therefore, which shows that is also fixed by . But then . Therefore, contains all the roots of , and thus must contain the splitting field of .  We have for some . If are the distinct polynomials among , then is the splitting field of the separable polynomial . By Corollary 6.28, is Galois over .  If for a normal subgroup , then .    Let for a normal subgroup of . We want to show that is isomorphic to .  For each , we claim that . By Lemma 6.10, for all the element is also a root of . But since is Galois, it must contain all of the roots of , by Corollary 6.26, so . Thus , so the restriction of to determines an injective field homomorphism . Since , this map is also a linear transformation of vector spaces over . But is a finite vector space over , and any injective linear transformation must be bijective. We conclude that is an automorphism of . We thus have a well-defined function   Moreover, this map is a group homomorphism by construction. The kernel is the subgroup of of automorphisms that restrict to the identity on , which is precisely . Hence we have an induced injective group homomorphism But , so this map must be an isomorphism.       Galois Correspondence and Lattices   The Galois correspondence induces a lattice isomorphism between the lattice of intermediate fields of a Galois extension and the “dual'' of the lattice of subgroups of .

Notice that without the theorem, it isn't even obvious that there are only a finite number of such intermediate fields.    We know corresponds to the element subgroup of generated by and where we number the roots as .  This group is isomorphic to and we can make this isomorphism explicit by labeling the four corners of a square by , counter-clockwise. So, is rotation by degrees and is reflection about the line joining vertices and .  The subgroup lattice and intermediate field lattice are represented below, with normal subgroups and Galois extensions highlighted (boxed).   and the lattices are of subgroups of and intermediate fields of are   The intermediate fields are the fixed subfields of associated to each of these subgroups. In some sense, this answers the question, but let's find explicit generators for at least some of these.   corresponds to and corresponds to .  Set . has degree over . It is clear (and ) belongs to and since , we must have .  Likewise .   also has degree four over . Let and note . If , then would be fixed by a subgroup of index that contains , and the only possibility is . But sends to . So we must have and hence .  I'll skip the details on and , but they are and .   has degree equal to over and so we merely need to find a single, non-rational element of fixed by . Since (which can be seen by looking back at how we built originally or by noting that ), we get .  I'll skip the details on , but it is .   also has degree two over and so we just need to find a single non-rational element fixed by the two generators of . Note that and so is fixed by both and . Thus .  Finally, we note that are normal subgroups of , since is the center of and each of has index two. Some messy checking reveals these to be the only normal subgroups. It follows from the that are the only intermediate fields that are Galois over . As an example, to see directly that is not Galois over , note that is a root of , which is irreducible. But is also a root of this polynomial and it is not in . We conclude from Proposition that is not a normal extension of .

Let be an irreducible, fifth degree polynomial in with exactly three real roots and let be its splitting field over . Let the real roots be and the imaginary ones be and . Then is isomorphic to . You will prove this on one of the final exam problems (for a specific case), but let me get you started with a couple {}: Show that is isomorphic to a subgroup of with . You may use (without justifying it) that if is a -cycle in and is any five cycle in , then the subgroup of they generate is all of .   Finding Unique Intermediate Field   If is a finite Galois extension of degree , then I claim there is a unique intermediate field with and that must be a Galois extension over .  To see this, set . Then and by the , there is a unique Sylow -subgroup, call it , and hence is normal in . It follows from the that is an intermediate field that   is Galois over and    satisfies . Moreover, it is unique since has just one subgroup of index .     In fact, there are exactly two groups of order up to isomorphism, the cyclic one and one that is a (non-trivial) semi-direct product of by . So, there are just two possible lattices of intermediate fields for such a field extension.     The Fundamental Theorem: Proof and Artin's Theorem  The following is an important theorem with many corollaries. In fact, the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, which we will state shortly, will follow from this result.  Artin's Theorem  Artin's theorem   Let be any field. If is a finite subgroup of , then is a subfield of , the extension is finite and Galois, and .    Note that we really do mean equality here: both and are subgroups of , and the theorem states that they coincide. The containment is clear: if , then by construction fixes every element of and hence . The point of the theorem is that the extension is always Galois and that if fixes every element of then must belong to .  We will not prove right away. Instead, we will first deduce some of its consequences, including the . We will then illustrate the Fundamental Theorem with many examples and give some consequences of it too. Only then will we circle back to prove .    The group , where is complex conjugation, is a finite subgroup of . tells us that is finite and Galois with Galois group . It follows that . We already knew all this, since .    As we head towards the , we start by stating a few helpful corollaries of . These will also allow us to show that finite Galois extensions are precisely the splitting fields of separable polynomials.    Let be any Galois extension. Then .    Note that holds by definition, and so by the Degree Formula. But Artin's Theorem gives and we also know that . Therefore, and thus .      We know from Example 6.14 that is Galois over with Galois group . More precisely, this identification is given by writting and labelling the four corners of a square with , counter-clockwise. Consider and . Then each of and are fixed by every Galois automorphism and hence by Corollary and must be rational. In fact, one can easily see that and , but notice that the exact same reasoning would apply in general to the sum of roots and the product of roots in the splitting field of any separable polynomial.      Let be a Galois extension. For every is separable and all of its roots belong to . Moreover, acts transitively on the set of roots of .     "

There are several computer algebra systems dedicated to algebraic geometry and commutative algebra computations, such as    Singular (more popular among algebraic geometers),     CoCoA (which is more popular with european commutative algebraists, having originated in Genova, Italy), and     Macaulay2 .   There are many computations you could run on any of these systems (and others), but we will focus on Macaulay2 since it's the most popular computer algebra system among US based commutative algebraists.  Macaulay2, as the name suggests, is a successor of a previous computer algebra system named Macaulay. Macaulay was first developed in 1983 by Dave Bayer and Mike Stillman, and while some still use it today, the system has not been updated since its final release in 2000. In 1993, Daniel Grayson and Mike Stillman released the first version of Macaulay2, and the current stable version of Macaulay2 1.16.  Macaulay2, or M2 for short, is an open-source project, with many contributors writing packages that are then released with the newest Macaulay2 version. Journals like the Journal of Software for Algebra and Geometry publish peer-refereed short articles that describe and explain the functionality of new packages, with the package source code being peer reviewed as well.  The National Science Foundation has funded Macaulay2 since 1992. Besides funding the project through direct grants, the NSF has also funded several Macaulay2 workshops — conferences where Macaulay2 package developers gather to work on new packages, and to share updates to the Macaulay2 core code and recent packages.   Commands in Macaulay2  A Macaulay2 session often starts with defining some ambient ring we will be doing computations over. Common rings such as the rationals and the integers can be defined using the commands QQ and ZZ ; one can easily take quotients or build polynomial rings (in finitely many variables) over these. For example,   and   both store the ring as , with the small difference that in the second example Macaulay2 has named the coefficient field . One quirk that might make a difference later is that if we use the first option and later set to be the field , our ring is not a polynomial ring over . Also, in the second example we ended each line with a ; , which tells Macaulay2 to run the command but not display the result of the computation — which is in this case was simply an assignment, so the result is not relevant.  We can now do all sorts of computations over our ring . For example, we can define an ideal in as follows:   Above we have set to be the ideal in that is generated by . The notation ideal( ) requires the usage of ^ for powers and * for products; alternatively, we can define the exact same ideal with the notation ideal\" \" , as follows:   Now we can use this ideal to either define a quotient ring or the -module , as follows:   It's important to note that while is a ring, is the -module — this is a very important difference for Macaulay2, since these two objects have different types. So defined above is a ring, while is a module. Notice that Macaulay2 stored the module as the cokernel of the map   When you make a new definition in Macaulay2, you might want to pay attention to what ring your new object is defined over. For example, now that we defined this ring , Macaulay2 has automatically taken to be our current ambient ring, and any calculation or definition we run next will be considered over and not . If you want to return to the original ring , you must first run the command use R   If you want to work over a finitely generated algebra over one of the basic rings you can define in Macaulay2, and your ring is not a quotient of a polynomial ring, you want to rewrite this algebra as a quotient of a polynomial ring. For example, suppose you want to work over the second Veronese in variables over our field from before, meaning the algebra . We need algebra generators, which we will call corresponding to and :   Our ring at the end is isomorphic to the 2nd Veronese of , which is the ring we wanted. Note the syntax order in map : first target, then source, then a list with the images of each algebra generator.  As you're learning how to use Macaulay2, you will often find yourself needing some help. Luckily, Macaulay2 can help you directly! For example, suppose you know the name of a command, but do not remember the syntax to use it. You can ask ?command , and Macaulay2 will show you the different usages of the command you want to know about.   If instead you'd rather read the complete Macaulay2 documentation on the command you are interested in, you can use the viewHelp command, which will open an html page with the documentation you asked for. So running   will open an html page dedicate to the method primaryDecomposition, which includes examples and links to related methods.  Many Macaulay2 commands are easy to guess, and named exactly what you would expect them to be named. Often, googling “Macaulay2” followed by a few descriptive words will easily land you on the documentation for whatever you are trying to do.  Here are some basic commands you will likely use:    ideal (f_1, \\dots , f_n) will return the ideal generated by . Here products should be indicated by * , and powers with ^ . If you'd rather not use ^ (this might be nice if you have lots of powers), you can write ideal (f_1, \\dots , f_n) instead.     map S, R, (f_1, \\dots , f_n) gives a ring map if and are rings, and is a quotient of . The resulting ring map will send . There are many variations of map — for example, you can use it to define -module homomorphisms — but you should carefully input the information in the required format. Try viewHelp map in Macaulay2 for more details.     ker returns the kernel of the map .     I + J and I*J return the sum and product of the ideals and , respectively.     A = matrix\\{\\{a_1,1, \\dots , a_1,n}, \\dots , {a_m,1, \\dots , a_m,n\\}\\} returns the matrix      As in most programming languages, Macaulay2 follows the convention that the first position in a list is the th position.  The method primaryDecomposition returns a list of primary ideals whose intersection is the input ideal, and associatedPrimes returns the list of associated primes of the given ideal or module. Operations on lists are often intuitive. For example, let's say we want to find the primary component of an ideal with a particular radical.   i1 : R = QQ[x,y]; i2 : I = ideal\"x2,xy\"; o2 : Ideal of R i3 : prim = primaryDecomposition I 2 o3 = {ideal x, ideal (y, x )} o3 : List i4 : L = select(prim, Q -> radical(Q) == ideal\"x,y\") 2 o4 = {ideal (y, x )} o4 : List  The method select returns a list of all the elements in our list with the required properties. In this case, if we actually want the primary ideal we just selected, as opposed to a list containing it, we need to extract the first component of our list .  i5 : L_0 2 o5 = ideal (y, x ) o5 : Ideal of R    "

Let be an integral domain that contains a field as a subring, and that moreover is finite dimensional as an -vector space.  Say has dimension over . Let . Consider elements which cannot be independent because of the finite dimension. So we may choose so that is linearly dependent over and is as small as possible.

Hence Thus factors into distinct linear polynomials, each of which is in the form for . Thus each linear term is an elementary divisor, making each Jordan block a matrix with as the only entry. Thus the Jordan Canonical form is     This time around the change of basis matrix (denoted and using the same basis as above) for this matrix has s along the diagonal, and increasing natural numbers (starting at , sorry) along the upper diagonal. Thus .  Recall that the minimal polynomial corresponding to will be the the smallest monic polynomial such that is sent to 0. Note that as is the operator sending to its derivative, and that . Thus can be viewed as a change of basis matrix for taking the second derivative of the basis, and so on.  As the basis extends to , it requires derivatives to make this polynomial become . Thus the minimal polynomial of must be , as it it monic and . As the degree of the invariant factors must sum to and , which is itself an invariant factor, we see that it must in fact be the only one.
