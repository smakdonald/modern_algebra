<div class="para">Sunzi’s Remainder Theorem frequently goes by the name of The Chinese Remainder Theorem, but it has been remarked that this is somewhat like referencing the Pythagorean Theorem as The Greek Triangle Theorem or Fermat’s Little Theorem as The French Power Postulate. In the interest of giving credit where credit is due, we include it here with the name of the 3rd-century Chinese mathematician, Sunzi, to whom the result is often attributed. </div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-ftfgag.html#sec-ftfgag-5">in-context</a></span>
