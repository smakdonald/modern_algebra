</div>
<div class="para">First, we show associativity. Let <span class="process-math">\(x,y,z\in H\)</span> (not necessarily distinct, as <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> might not have three distinct elements). As <span class="process-math">\(H\leq G\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(x,y,z\in G\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is a group is satisfies the associative property, and thus <span class="process-math">\((xy)z=x(yz)\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> satisfies the associative property as well.</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">I claim that <span class="process-math">\(e_G\in H\text{,}\)</span> and further that <span class="process-math">\(e_G\)</span> is the identity element of <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is non-empty, there exists some <span class="process-math">\(h \in H\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(xy^{-1} \in H\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x,y \in H\text{,}\)</span> setting both <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=h\)</span> we see <span class="process-math">\(hh\inv\in H\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(e_G\in H\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(H\sse G\text{,}\)</span> we see</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">

<div class="para">for any <span class="process-math">\(x\in H\text{,}\)</span> making <span class="process-math">\(e_G\)</span> the identity element of <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="para">Now I show each element of <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> has an inverse in <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(h\in H\text{.}\)</span> By setting <span class="process-math">\(x=e_G\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=h\text{,}\)</span> we see <span class="process-math">\(e_Gh\inv\in H\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(e_G\)</span> is the identity element of <span class="process-math">\(H\text{,}\)</span> we see <span class="process-math">\(e_Gh\inv = h\inv\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(h\inv\in H\text{.}\)</span> Hence every element of <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> has an inverse contained in <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">Finally, we must show that the restriction of the group operation of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is a well-defined group operation. In other words, given <span class="process-math">\(x,y\in H\text{,}\)</span> it must be the case that <span class="process-math">\(xy\in H\text{.}\)</span> Given <span class="process-math">\(x,y \in H\text{,}\)</span> from the previous paragraph we know <span class="process-math">\(y^{-1} \in H\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(xy = x(y^{-1})^{-1} \in H\text{,}\)</span> which is what we wanted. This means This operation is associative by the axioms for the group <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> The axioms of a group have now been established for <span class="process-math">\((H, \cdot)\text{.}\)</span>

Then, for <span class="process-math">\(x,y\in H\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(y^{-1}\in H\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(xy^{-1}\in H\text{.}\)</span> Since the hypothesis of the one-step test is satisfied, <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is a subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span>
